************
Installation
************

* Gammapy works with legacy Python (version 2.7) as well as Python 3 (version 3.5 or above).
* The core dependencies are Numpy and Astropy, as well as for now the regions package
  (until it is merged into Astropy core).
* The main optional dependencies are PyYAML, Scipy, healpy, uncertainties and Sherpa
  (only imported when used).
* Linux and Mac OS are fully supported.
* Windows is fully supported by Gammapy, but not by Sherpa (which is used as a backend for
  modeling and fitting in Gammapy), so on Windows only part of the Gammapy functionality is available.
* You can always check what the latest stable release of Gammapy is here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gammapy

==========

If you're not sure how to best install Gammapy on your machine (e.g. whether to use
conda or pip or Macports ...), we recommend that you give conda a try first.
It's a binary package manager (so generally installation is fast), and allows you to
install any software in your home folder (without needing ``sudo``) and works the
same on Linux, Mac OS and Windows. Many Gammapy users and developers use conda
and are happy with it.

If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to ask on the `Gammapy mailing list`_!
