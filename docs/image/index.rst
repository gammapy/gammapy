Introduction
============

`gammapy.image` contains data classes and methods for image based analysis
of gamma-ray data.


Getting Started
===============

The central data structure in `gammapy.image` is the `SkyImage`
class, which combines the raw data with WCS information, FITS I/O functionality
and many other methods, that allow easy handling, processing and plotting of
image based data. Here is a first example:

.. plot::
    :include-source:

	from gammapy.image import SkyImage
	filename = '$GAMMAPY_EXTRA/datasets/fermi_2fhl/fermi_2fhl_vela.fits.gz'
	image = SkyImage.read(filename, hdu=2)
	image.show()

This loads a prepared Fermi 2FHL FITS image of the Vela region, creates a
`SkyImage` and shows it on the the screen by calling `SkyImage.show()`.

To explore further the SkyImage class try tab completion on the ``image`` object
in an interactive python environment or see the :doc:`sky_image` page.
