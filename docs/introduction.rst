Introduction
============

Show me some code!
------------------

gammapy gives you easy access to some frequently used methods in TeV gamma-ray astronomy from Python.

What's the statistical significance when 10 events have been observed with a known background level of 4.2
according to [LiMa1983]_?

Call the `~gammapy.stats.poisson.significance` function::

   >>> from gammapy.stats import significance
   >>> significance(n_observed=10, mu_background=4.2, method='lima')
   2.3979181291475453

What's the differential gamma-ray flux and spectral index of the Crab nebula at 3 TeV
according to [Meyer2010]_?

Call the `~gammapy.spectrum.crab.crab_flux` and `~gammapy.spectrum.crab.crab_spectral_index` functions::

   >>> from gammapy.spectrum import crab_flux, crab_spectral_index
   >>> energy = 3
   >>> crab_flux(energy, reference='meyer')
   1.8993523278650278e-12
   >>> crab_spectral_index(energy, reference='meyer')
   2.6763224503600429

All functionality is in subpackages (e.g. `gammapy.stats` or `gammapy.spectrum`) ...
browse their docs to see if it contains the methods you want.

But I don't know how to code in Python!
---------------------------------------

Hmm ... OK.

Some of the ``gammapy`` functionality can be called from command line tools.

But, to be honest, if you're an astronomer, you should learn to code in Python.
Start at http://python4astronomers.github.io or `here <http://www.astropy.org>`_  

For example, if you have a counts and background model image and would like to compute
a significance image with a correlation radius of 0.1 deg::

   $ gp-make-derived-maps --in counts.fits background.fits \
                           --meaning counts background
                           --out significance.fits
                           --correlation_radius 0.1

Say you have an image that contains the
`Crab nebula <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_Nebula>`_
and want to look up the map value at the Crab position 
(name lookup is done with `SIMBAD <http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/>`_)::

   $ gp-lookup-map-values crab_image.fits --object "Crab"

You can call ``gp-tool-name --help`` for any tool.

A full list of available command line tools can be found in ``tools``.
