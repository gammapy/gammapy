    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)](https://www.cta-observatory.org/) is the next generation ground-based observatory for gamma-ray astronomy.\n",
    "Gammapy is the core library for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) science tools ([2017ICRC...35..766D](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ICRC...35..766D) and [CTAO Press Release](https://www.cta-observatory.org/ctao-adopts-the-gammapy-software-package-for-science-analysis/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "CTA will start taking data in the coming years. For now, to learn how to analyse CTA data and to use Gammapy, if you are a member of the CTA consortium, you can use the simulated dataset from the CTA first data challenge which ran in 2017 and 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://forge.in2p3.fr/projects/data-challenge-1-dc-1/wiki (CTA internal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gammapy fully supports the FITS data formats (events, IRFs) used in CTA 1DC. The XML sky model format is not supported, but are also not needed to analyse the data, you have to specify your model via the Gammapy YAML model format, or Python code, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Gammapy to simulate CTA data and evaluate CTA performance using the CTA response files available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://www.cta-observatory.org/science/cta-performance/\n",
    "\n",
    "The current FITS format `CTA-Performance-prod3b-v2-FITS.tar` is fully supported by Gammapy, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to access CTA data and instrument response functions (IRFs) using Gammapy, and gives some examples how to quick look the content of CTA files, especially to see the shape of CTA IRFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the notebooks, we give several links to other tutorial notebooks that show how to simulate CTA data and how to evaluate CTA observability and sensitivity, or how to analyse CTA data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the FITS data and IRF format currently used by CTA is the one documented at https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/, and is also used by H.E.S.S. and other imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). So if you see other Gammapy tutorials using e.g. H.E.S.S. example data, know that they also apply to CTA, all you have to do is to change the loaded data or IRFs to CTA.\n",

    "The CTA first data challenge (1DC) ran in 2017 and 2018. It is described in detail [here](https://forge.in2p3.fr/projects/data-challenge-1-dc-1/wiki) and a description of the data and how to download it is [here](https://forge.in2p3.fr/projects/data-challenge-1-dc-1/wiki#Data-access).\n",

After download, follow the instructions how to `untar` the files, and set a `CTADATA` environment variable to point to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, since the 1DC data files are large, and not publicly available to anyone, we have taken a tiny subset of the CTA 1DC data, four observations with the southern array from the GPS survey, pointing near the Galactic center, and included them at `$GAMMAPY_DATA/cta-1dc` which you get via `gammapy download tutorials`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will show a quick overview of the files and how to load them, and some quick look plots showing the shape of the CTA IRFs. How to do CTA simulations and analyses is shown in other tutorials, see links at the end of this notebook."

    "- The IRFs contain the energy and offset dependence of the CTA response\n",
    "- CTA 1DC was based on an early version of the CTA FITS responses produced in 2017, improvements have been made since.\n",
    "- The point spread function was approximated by a Gaussian shape\n",
    "- The background is from hadronic and electron air shower events that pass CTA selection cuts. It was given as a function of field of view coordinates, although it is radially symmetric.\n",
    "- The energy dispersion in CTA 1DC is noisy at low energy, leading to unreliable spectral points for some analyses.\n",
    "- The CTA 1DC response files have the first node at field of view offset 0.5 deg, so to get the on-axis response at offset 0 deg, Gammapy has to extrapolate. Furthermore, because diffuse gamma-rays in the FOV were used to derive the IRFs, and the solid angle at small FOV offset circles is small, the IRFs at the center of the FOV are somewhat noisy. This leads to unstable analysis and simulation issues when using the DC1 IRFs for some analyses."
