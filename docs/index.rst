What is Gammapy?
----------------

Gammapy is a community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy.

* Ask questions on the `Gammapy mailing list`_.
* Request features, report bugs or contribute on the `Gammapy GitHub page`_.
* Gammapy works with Python 2 and 3, on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Where to start?

* Check out the "Getting started with Gammapy" Jupyter notebooks.
    * Read the static HTML version on
      `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gammapy/gammapy-extra/blob/master/index.ipynb>`__.
    * Try an executable version at `Gammapy binder`_.
    * Clicking that link will start a Docker image on some cloud server,
      which usually takes about 30 seconds.
