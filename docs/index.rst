Gammapy
-------

Gammapy is a community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray
astronomy built on Numpy, Scipy and Astropy. It is a prototype for the `CTA`_ science tools
and can also be used to analyse data from existing imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
(IACTs), such as `H.E.S.S.`_, `MAGIC`_ and `VERITAS`_. It also provides some support
for `Fermi-LAT`_ and `HAWC`_ data analysis.

This webpage contains the Gammapy documentation. You may also check out the `Gammapy webpage <https://gammapy.org>`_
where you may find more information about Gammapy, including the
`list of releases <https://gammapy.org/news.html#releases>`_ and contact information if you
have any questions, want to report and issue or request a feature, or need help with anything
Gammapy-related.
