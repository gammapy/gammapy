What is Gammapy?
----------------

**Gammapy** is an open source (BSD licensed) gamma-ray astronomy Python package.

It is an in-development `affiliated package <http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`__ of `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__ 
that builds on the core `scientific Python stack <http://www.scipy.org/about.html>`__ to provide tools to simulate and analyse
the gamma-ray sky for telescopes such as `CTA <https://www.cta-observatory.org/>`__, `H.E.S.S. <http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/>`__,
and `Fermi <http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`__.

Gammapy is a place for Python-coding gamma-ray astronomers to share their code and collaborate.

Support Gammapy
---------------

If you use Gammapy in your work, we would be grateful if you could include an acknowledgment in papers and/or presentations.

Currently there is no academic reference for Gammapy.
We have submitted a poster for `ICRC 2015 <http://icrc2015.nl/>`__
and plan to write a paper about it after the Gammapy 1.0 release in August 2015.

For now, you could mention the URL https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy or include the Gammapy banner.
