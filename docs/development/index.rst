The developer documentation is a collection of notes for Gammapy developers and maintainers.
If something is not covered here, have a look at the very extensive
`Astropy developer documentation <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/#developer-documentation>`__,
as well. If you want to contribute to Gammapy just use one of the `contact points <https://gammapy.org/contact.html>`__
listed on the Gammapy webpage. Ideally you join directly the #dev channel in the Gammapy Slack.
