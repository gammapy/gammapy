Abstract
========

Now that we have a good way to distribute Gammapy and to ship a science tool
environment to users, we propose to drop support and testing for old versions of
dependencies, and alternative distribution channels. Concretely, we propose to
require Python 3.6, Numpy 1.16 and Astropy 3.2 starting with Gammapy v0.14, and
to remove the Macports installation instructions from the Gammapy documentation.

We think the impact for users is small (none for most), but the benefit for
Gammapy developers and maintainers is big, allowing us to progress more quickly.

If you use Gammapy and need to run on old machines or exotic platforms, and this
change doesn't work for you, let us know!

Introduction
============

Since Gammapy v0.7, released in Feb 2018, the recommended way to install
Gammapy and its dependencies has been via conda. This has worked well, allowing
us to ship a reproducible science tool environment with up-to-date versions to
all Gammapy users for each Gammapy release.

Each stable release for Gammapy is first published as a source distribution on
https://pypi.org/project/gammapy/. Then conda binaries for Linux, macOS and
Windows will be built via conda-forge, and uploaded to
https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gammapy. Finally we write a conda environment
specification file that we publish on gammapy.org, and the end-user installation
instructions look like this::

    curl -O https://gammapy.org/download/install/gammapy-0.13-environment.yml
    conda env create -f gammapy-0.13-environment.yml
    conda activate gammapy-0.13

Dependencies
------------

For the rest of this document, we would like to define and describe what we mean
when talking about "required" and "optional" dependencies for Gammapy:

- the required dependencies are the Python packages that get automatically
  installed when running ``pip install gammapy`` or ``conda install gammapy -c
  conda-forge``.
- the optional dependencies are the ones listed in the conda environment
  specification, that are not already required dependencies.

For example Numpy and Astropy are required dependencies of Gammapy, and
matplotlib, Jupyter or Naima are optional dependencies. Complete tables of all
required and optional dependencies that we have at the moment are given below.

The choice which dependencies are required or optional (or neither) is something
we make in the metadata of the Gammapy source distribution. Our reasoning is to
declare a dependency as required if it's needed by the vast majority of Gammapy
users, and for optional dependencies, we include all packages that are used
somewhere within the Gammapy package, or in examples and tutorials in the
Gammapy documentation.

We note that these two sets of dependencies are just the default, recommended
sets, it is possible to install Gammapy even without installing the required
dependencies, and of course users can install and use Gammapy together with
other Python packages, e.g. scikit-learn or whatever they like.

Distributions
-------------

There are many distribution channels for Gammapy just as is the case for most
open-source software. E.g. at this time there is a Debian and Macports package
for Gammapy. conda is not the only, but it is the only fully supported
distribution channel for Gammapy. The reason for this is that currently manpower
and expertise in the Gammapy team is limited, and conda provides, as far as we
know, a solution that works for all users. At this time, no-one from the Gammapy
is using Macports any more, for pip there are no binary wheels published yet for
Gammapy and astropy-regions, Debian only works for Debian users and has a longer
update cycle compared to the current Gammapy 2 month release cycle, and e.g. for
Homebrew no-one packaged Gammapy so far.

Required dependencies
=====================

We propose to update the Gammapy required dependencies as shown in the following
table (the release dates for the packages are shown in parentheses are were
obtained from https://pypi.org/).

===============  ================  ================
Dependency       Gammapy 0.13      Gammapy 0.14
===============  ================  ================
Python           3.5   (Sep 2015)  3.6   (Dec 2016)
Numpy            1.10  (May 2016)  1.16  (Jan 2019)
Scipy            0.15  (Jan 2015)  1.2   (Dec 2018)
Astropy          2.0   (Jul 2017)  3.2   (Jun 2019)
regions          0.4   (Jun 2019)  0.5   (Sep 2019)
pyyaml           unclear           5.1   (Mar 2019)
click            unclear           7.0   (Sep 2018)
jsonschema       --                3.0   (Feb 2019)
===============  ================  ================

We already mentioned the possibility to drop Python 3.5 support in
:ref:`pig-003`. One reason is that Anaconda and conda-forge (our main
distribution channel, used in our testing continuous integration setup) only
contains Python 2.7, 3.6 and 3.7 at this point (and 3.8 added in fall 2018),
i.e. testing on Python 3.5 is already extra effort. Also, Python 3.6 contains
some nice new features that developers can use. E.g. Sunpy or ctapipe already
require Python 3.6 or later.

A major motivation to update to very recent versions is that the ``regions``
package is still under development (see :ref:`pig-010`). In Gammapy 0.13 we
require regions 0.4, and we plan to make a regions 0.5 release with further
features and fixes in September, and to require that for Gammapy 0.14.

For ``pyyaml``, we would like to use the recent version, since it allows writing
with preserved dictionary key order, giving a nice output, whereas previously it
always sorted keys alphabetically on YAML write.

The current Gammapy command line interface is using ``click``. Whether to keep
this or whether to use something else will be discussed in `PIG 12`_. For now,
we propose to keep things as-is, and only specify a minimum version that we'll
test, although in practice we didn't have any version-dependent issues with
``click`` in the past years.

We plan to use ``jsonschema`` to validate YAML config files. It's a small,
pure-Python dependency.

Optional dependencies
=====================

We propose to update the Gammapy optional dependencies as shown in the following
table (the release dates for the packages are shown in parentheses are were
obtained from https://pypi.org/).

===============  ================  ================
Dependency       Gammapy 0.13      Gammapy 0.14
===============  ================  ================
ipython          7.3   (Feb 2019)  7.6   (Jun 2019)
jupyter          1.0   (n/a)       1.0   (n/a)
jupyterlab       0.35  (Oct 2018)  1.0   (Jun 2019)             
matplotlib       2.1   (Oct 2017)  3.0   (Sep 2018)
pandas           0.24  (Jan 2019)  0.25  (Jul 2019)
healpy           1.11  (Aug 2017)  1.12  (Jun 2018)
reproject        0.4   (Jan 2018)  0.5   (Jun 2019)
uncertainties    3.0   (Aug 2016)  3.1   (May 2019)
iminuit          1.3   (Jul 2018)  1.3.7 (Jun 2019)
sherpa           4.11  (Feb 2019)  4.11  (Feb 2019)
naima            0.8   (Dec 2016)  0.8.3 (Nov 2018)
emcee            --                2.2   (Jul 2016)
corner           --                2.0   (May 2016)
parfive          --                1.0   (May 2019)
===============  ================  ================

We plan to use ``parfive`` for tutorial notebook and example dataset file
download (features parallel download and a progress bar).

Distributions
=============

The situation concerning distribution was described in the introduction above,
and some alternatives and future work are mentioned in the outlook and
alternatives sections below.

We propose to remove the Macports installation page from the Gammmapy
documentation, and to just leave a mention that it's outdated and unsupported on
the page on "other ways to install Gammapy". Short sections or pages about pip
and Debian will remain at the end of the installation instructions, for advanced
users.

For conda, we will improve the installation instructions, explaining the
difference between using the recommended environment and a plain ``conda install
-c conda-forge gammapy``, and add lists of required and optional dependencies as
above to the Gammapy installation documentation.

Outlook
=======

This PIG describes only the status and very short term plan for Gammapy v0.14
and v1.0! We expect that dependencies and distribution will evolve in the coming
years.

E.g. we might add Numba as a dependency, or we might start to fully support pip,
if binary wheels for Gammapy and all dependencies are available (there is a
recent effort to implement this).

Somewhat related to this PIG: we plan to modernise Gammapy packaging following
the recommendations in `APE 17`_. Work on this has already started in `GH
2279`_.

We could support other ways to ship Gammapy, e.g. Homebrew (works on MacOS and
also Linux now), or Docker images (works anywhere, self-contained).

Alternatives
============

Since we have a working setup already, we could do nothing, which seems nice at
first, but really means continued time sink and suffering by the Gammapy
maintainers of the continuous integration testing system and the release
manager.

For conda, we should strongly consider introducing a ``gammapy-all`` metapackage
instead of the current ``gammapy-environment.yml`` shipped via ``gammapy.org``.
That's what e.g. the Fermi tools and glueviz and others do, and they like that
solution. It does have the advantage ob using a conda-native solution to the
question how to ship an environment. This could be prototyped any time, in
parallel with the existing solution, to gain familiarity with metapackages.


Task list
=========

- Update continuous integration test matrix to test against the minimum required
  versions as specified here (and also newer versions in addition) (`GH 2270`_).
- Drop Python 3.5 support and modernise codebase (e.g. use f-strings and use
  dict instead of OrderedDict).
- Review Gammapy codebase and remove workarounds for old Python, Numpy, Astropy,
  ... versions.
- Remove ``extras_require`` in ``setup.py``
  (don't attempt to maintain the list of optional dependencies there)
- Review, restructure and update all Gammapy installation instructions
- Clearly describe all required and optional dependencies in the docs

Decision
========

This proposal was extensively discussed at the July 2019 Gammapy coding sprint.
In the feedback phase we didn't get a single comment asking for continued
support of older versions. Thus the proposal was accepted on Sep 9.
