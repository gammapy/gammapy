Gammapy project setup
=====================

This page gives an overview of the technical infrastructure we have set up to
develop and maintain Gammapy.

If you just want to make contribution to the Gammapy code or documentation, you
don't need to know about most of the things mentioned on this page!

But for Gammapy maintainers it's helpful to have a reference that explains what
we have and how things work.

gammapy repository
==================

This section explains the content of the main repository for Gammapy:

    https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy

Package and docs
----------------

The two main folders of interest for developers are the ``gammapy`` folder and
the ``docs`` folder. In ``gammapy`` you find the Gammapy package, i.e. all code,
but also tests are included there in sub-folders called ``tests``. The ``docs``
folder contains the documentation pages in restructured text (RST) format. The
Sphinx documentation generator is used to convert those RST files to the HTML
documentation.

Tutorials
---------

The ``tutorials`` folder contains Jupyter notebooks that are part of the user
documentation for Gammapy. They are copied to a ``docs/notebooks`` folder during
the process of documentation building and converted to the Sphinx-formatted HTML
files that you find in the :ref:`tutorials` section. Raw Jupyter notebooks files and
``.py`` scripts versions are placed in the ``docs/_static/notebooks`` folder
generated during the documentation building process.

We do have automated testing for notebooks set up (just check that they run
and don't raise an exception) in Travis CI (see below) which runs
``python -m gammapy.utils.tutorials_test`` and looks at the ``tutorials/notebooks.yaml``
file for which notebooks to test or not to test. It is also possible to perform
tests locally on notebooks  with the ``gammapy jupyter`` command. This command provides
functionalities for testing, code formatting, stripping output cells and execution. See
``gammapy jupyter -h`` for more info on this.

The ``gammapy download`` command allows to download notebooks published as tutorials
as well as the related datasets needed to execute them. For stable releases, the list of
tutorials to download, their locations and datasets used are declared in YAML files
placed in the ``download/tutorials`` folder of the `gammapy-webpage`
`Github repository <https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-webpage>`__.
The same happens for conda working environments of stable releases declared
in ``download/install`` folder of that repository. The datasets are not versioned and
are similarly declared in the ``download/data`` folder.

.. _dev_build:

Build
-----

The ``setup.py`` and ``Makefile`` contain code to build and install Gammapy, as
well as to run the tests and build the documentation, see :ref:`dev_intro`.

The ``environment-dev.yml`` file contains the conda environment specification
that allows one to quickly set up a conda environment for Gammapy development,
see :ref:`dev_setup`.

The ``astropy_helpers`` folder is a git submodule pointing to
https://github.com/astropy/astropy-helpers It is used from ``setup.py`` (also
using ``ah_bootstrap.py``) and provides helpers related to Python build,
installation and packaging, including a robust way to build C and Cython code
from ``setup.py``, as well as pytest extensions for testing and Sphinx
extensions for the documentation build. If you look into those Python files, you
will find that they are highly complex, and full of workarounds for old versions
of Python, setuptools, Sphinx etc. Note that this is not code that we develop
and maintain in Gammapy. Gammapy was started from
https://github.com/astropy/package-template and there are besides the
``astropy_helpers`` folder a few files (``ah_bootstrap.py``, ``setup.py``
``setup.cfg`` and ``gammapy/_astropy_init.py``) that are needed, but rarely
need to be looked at or updated. The Astropy team has set up a bot that from time to time makes pull
requests to update the affiliated packages (including Gammapy) as new versions
of ``astropy_helpers`` and the extra files are released.

The ``Dockerfile`` and ``binder.py`` files are used for Binder, see below.

Version
-------

One more thing worth pointing out is how versioning for Gammapy works. Getting a
correct version number in all cases (stable or dev version, installed package or
in-place build in the source folder, ...) is surprisingly complex for Python
packages. For Gammapy, the version is computed at build time, by ``setup.py``
calling into the ``get_git_devstr`` helper function, and writing it to the
auto-generated file ``gammapy/version.py``. This file is then part of the
Gammapy package, and is imported via ``gammapy/_astropy_init.py`` from
``gammapy/__init__.py``. This means that one can simply do this and always get
the right version for Gammapy::

    >>> import gammapy
    >>> gammapy.__version__
    >>> gammapy.__githash__

.. _setup_cython:

Cython
------

We also have some Cython code in Gammapy, at the time of this writing less than
1% in these two files:

* ``gammapy/detect/_test_statistics_cython.pyx``
* ``gammapy/maps/_sparse.pyx``

and again as part of the Astropy package template there is the
``gammapy/_compiler.c`` file to help ``setup.py`` figure out information about
the C compiler at build time. These are the files that are compiled by Cython
and your C compiler when you build the Gammapy package, as explained in
:ref:`dev_intro`.

Other
-----

There are two more folders in the ``gammapy`` repo: ``examples`` and ``dev``. We
started with the ``examples`` folder with the idea to have Gammapy usage
examples there and have them be part of the user documentation. But this is not
the case at the moment, rather ``examples`` is a collection of scripts that have
mostly been used by developers to develop and debug Gammapy code. Most can
probably just be deleted, some should be moved to user documentation (not clear
where, could move all content to notebooks) or automated tests. The idea for the
``dev`` folder was to just have a place for scripts and checks and notes by
Gammapy developers. Like for ``examples``, it's mostly outdated cruft and should
probably be cleaned out.

The files ``azure-pipelines.yml``, ``.travis.yml``, ``appveyor.yml`` and
``lgtm.yml`` are the configuration files for the continuous
integration (CI) and documentation build / hosting cloud services we use. They
are described in sections further down on this page.

Finally, there are some folders that are generated and filled by various build
steps:

* ``build`` contains the Gammapy package if you run ``python setup.py build``.
  If you run ``python setup.py install``, first the build is run and files
  placed there, and after that files are copied from the ``build`` folder to
  your ``site-packages``.
* ``docs/_build`` contains the generated documentation, especially ``docs/_build/html`` the HTML version.
* ``htmlcov`` and ``.coverage`` is where the test coverage report is stored.
* ``v`` is a folder Pytest uses for caching information about failing tests across test runs.
  This is what makes it possible to execute tests e.g. with the ``--lf`` option
  and just run the tests that "last failed".
* ``dist`` contains the Gammapy distribution if you run ``python setup.py sdist``

.. _dev_gammapy-extra:

gammapy-extra repository
========================

For Gammapy we have a second repository for most of the example data files and
a few other things:

    https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra

Example data
------------

The ``datasets`` and ``datasets/tests`` folders contain example datasets that are
used by the Gammapy documentation and tests. Note that here is a lot of old
cruft, because Gammapy was developed since 2013 in parallel with the development
of data formats for gamma-ray astronomy (see below).

Many old files in those folders can just be deleted; in some cases where
documentation or tests access the old files, they should be changed to access
newer files or generate test datasets from scratch. Doing this "cleanup" and
improvement of curated example datasets will be an ongoing task in Gammapy for
the coming years, that has to proceed in parallel with code, test and
documentation improvements.

Other
-----

* The ``figures`` folder contains images that we show in the documentation (or
  in presentations or publications), for cases where the analysis and image
  takes a while to compute (i.e. something we don't want to do all the time
  during the Gammapy documentation build). In each case, there should be a
  Python script to generate the image.
* The ``experiments`` and ``checks`` folders contain Python scripts and
  notebooks with, well, experiments and checks by Gammapy developers. Some are
  still work in progress and of interest, most could probably be deleted.
* The ``logo`` folder contains the Gammapy logo and banner in a few different variants.
* The ``posters`` and ``presentations`` folders contain a few Gammapy posters
  and presentations, for cases where the poster or presentation isn't available
  somewhere else on the web. It's hugely incomplete and probably not very useful
  as-is, and we should discuss if this is useful at all, and if yes, how we want
  to maintain it.

Other repositories
==================

Performance benchmarks for Gammapy:

* https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-benchmarks

Data from tutorials sometimes accesses files here:

* https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat
* https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-fermi-lat-data

Information from meetings is here:

* https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-meetings

Gammapy webpages
================

There are two webpages for Gammapy: gammapy.org and docs.gammapy.org.

In addition we have Binder set up to allow users to try Gammapy in the browser.

gammapy.org
-----------

https://gammapy.org/ is a small landing page for the Gammapy project. The page
shown there a static webpage served via Github pages.

To update it, edit the HTML and CSS files this repo:
https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-webpage and then make a pull request against
the default branch for that repo, called ``gh-pages``. Once it's merged, the
webpage at https://gammapy.org/ usually updates within less than a minute.

docs.gammapy.org
----------------

https://docs.gammapy.org/ contains most of the documentation for Gammapy,
including information about Gammapy, the changelog, tutorials, ...

TODO: describe how to update.

Gammapy Binder
--------------

We have set up https://mybinder.org/ for Gammapy, which allows users to execute
the tutorial Jupyter notebooks in the web browser, without having to install
software or download data to their local machine. This can be useful for people
to get started, and for tutorials. Every HTML-fixed version of the tutorial notebooks
that you can find in the :ref:`tutorials` section has a link to Binder that allows
you to execute the tutorial in the myBinder cloud infrastructure.

myBinder provides versioned virtual environments coupled with every Github commit
of the `gammapy`
`Github repository <https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy>`__. The Binder docker image
is created using the ``Dockerfile`` and ``binder.py`` files. The Dockerfile makes
the Docker image used by Binder running some linux commands to install base-packages
and copy the tutorials and datasets neeeded. It executes ``binder.py`` to conda
install Gammapy dependencies listed in the environment YAML file placed in the
``download/install`` folder of the `gammapy-webpage`
`Github repository <https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-webpage>`__

Continuous integration
======================

We are running various builds on the following two CI platforms:

* https://dev.azure.com/gammapy/gammapy
* https://travis-ci.org/gammapy/gammapy

Code quality
============

* Code quality: https://landscape.io/github/gammapy/gammapy/master
* Code coverage: https://coveralls.io/r/gammapy/gammapy

Releases
========

At this time, making a Gammapy release is a sequence of steps to execute in the
command line and on some webpages, that is fully documented in this checklist:
:ref:`dev-release`. It is difficult to automate this procedure more, but it is
already pretty straightforward and quick to do. If all goes well, making a
release takes about 1 hour of human time and one or two days of real time, with
the building of the conda binary packages being the slowest step, something we
wait for before announcing a new release to users (because many use conda and
will try to update as soon as they get the announcement email).

* Source distribution releases: https://pypi.org/project/gammapy/
* Binary conda packages for Linux, Mac and Windows:
  https://github.com/conda-forge/gammapy-feedstock

Data formats
============

Data formats should be defined here, and then linked to from the Gammapy docs:

* https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/gamma-astro-data-formats
* http://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io
