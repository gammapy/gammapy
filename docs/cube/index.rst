Introduction
============

The `gammapy.cube` sub-package contains functions and classes to make maps
(counts, exposure, background), as well as to compute an effective PSF and
energy dispersion for a given set of observations.

It also contains classes that represent cube models (sky maps with an energy
axis), and classes to evaluate and fit those models to data.
