Other related packages
----------------------

Besides Gammapy, there are two other major open-source analysis packages (that we are aware of)
for multi-mission gamma-ray likelihood analysis:

* `Gammalib`_ /`ctools`_ is a C++ package with Python wrapper, similar to the Fermi-LAT ScienceTools,
  that to a large degree uses the same input data formats as Gammapy.
* `3ML`_ is a Python package that uses existing packages (e.g. the Fermi-LAT ScienceTools or the HAWC software)
  to deal with the data and IRFs and compute the likelihood for a given model.

So there is some overlap of Gammapy with other efforts, but as mentioned in  :ref:`about-overview` the scope
of Gammapy is larger. And also all packages are new and the implementations radically different, so that's
a good thing when it comes to flexibility and the ability to cross-check results and methods.

Make sure to also check out the following packages that contain very useful functionality for gamma-ray astronomy:

* `Sherpa`_ --- X-ray modeling and fitting package by the Chandra X-ray Center
* `ctapipe`_ --- CTA Python pipeline experimental version
* `FermiPy`_ --- Fermi-LAT science tools high-level Python interface by Matthew Wood
* `gammatools`_ --- Python tools for Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data analysis by Matthew Wood
* `pointlike`_ -- Fermi-LAT science tools alternative by Toby Burnett
* `naima`_ --- an SED modeling and fitting package by Victor Zabalza
* `Gamera`_, `Gappa`_ --- a C++ gamma-ray source modeling package (SED, SNR model, Galactic population model) with a Python wrapper called Gappa by Joachim Hahn
* `FLaapLUC`_ --- Fermi/LAT automatic aperture photometry Light C<->Urve pipeline by Jean-Philippe Lenain
* http://voparis-cta-client.obspm.fr/ --- prototype web app for CTA data access / analysis, not open source.

Some other projects:

* `act-analysis`_ --- Python scripts and Makefiles for some common gamma-ray data analysis tasks by Karl Kosack
* `VHEObserverTools`_ --- tools to predict detectability at VHE by Jeremy Perkins
* `photon_simulator`_ --- Python code to simulate X-ray observations
* `pycrflux`_ --- Python module to plot cosmic-ray flux

Other useful packages
---------------------

In addition to the packages mentioned in the last section and at :ref:`install-dependencies`,
here's a few other Python packages you might find useful / interesting:

* See the list here: http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/
* Pulsar timing package `PINT`_
* `iminuit`_ fitter and `probfit`_ likelihood function builder.
* Andy strong has C++ codes (GALPROP and Galplot) for Galactic cosmic rays and emission
  and source population synthesis at http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~aws/propagate.html .
