Other related packages
----------------------

Besides Gammapy, there are two other major open-source analysis packages (that we are aware of)
for multi-mission gamma-ray likelihood analysis:

- `Gammalib`_/`ctools`_ is a C++ package with Python wrapper, similar to the Fermi-LAT ScienceTools,
  that uses the same input file formats as Gammapy.
- `3ML` is a Python package that uses existing packages (e.g. the Fermi-LAT ScienceTools or the HAWC software)
  to deal with the data and IRFs and compute the likelihood for a given model.

So there is some overlap of Gammapy with other efforts, but as mentioned in  :ref:`about-overview` the scope
of Gammapy is larger. And also all packages are new and the implementations radically different, so that's
a good thing when it comes to flexibility and the ability to cross-check results and methods.

Make sure to also check out the following packages that contain very useful functionality for gamma-ray astronomy:

* `Sherpa`_ --- X-ray modeling and fitting package by the Chandra X-ray Center
* `gammalib`_ and `ctools`_ --- Gamma-ray data analysis library and tools by Jürgen Knödlseder
* `ctapipe`_ --- CTA Python pipeline experimental version
* `threeml`_ --- the multi-missing maximum likelihood framework by Giacomo Vianello and others from Stanford
  (`code <https://github.com/giacomov/3ML>`__,
  `example notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/giacomov/3ML/blob/master/examples/090217206.ipynb>`__)
* `gammatools`_ --- Python tools for Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data analysis by Matthew Wood
* `naima`_ --- an SED modeling and fitting package by Victor Zabalza
* `GamERa`_ --- a C++ gamma-ray source modeling package (SED, SNR model, Galactic population model) by Joachim Hahn
* `Enrico <https://github.com/gammapy/enrico/>`__ --- helps you with your Fermi data analysis
* http://voparis-cta-client.obspm.fr/ --- prototype web app for CTA data access / analysis, not open source.
