What's new?
~~~~~~~~~~~

This release is a bug fix for v0.20. It corrects several issues that were recently reported and
improves the documentation .

Data with `Background2D` IRFs were not handled correctly by the `MapDatasetMaker` in v0.20.
This is now corrected.

Error bars in spectral excess plots were not correctly computed which resulted in inconsistent
displays between excess and residual panels. The correct excess error is now computed.

Spectral extraction with point-like IRFs can fail is some cases where no counts are found within the
radmax extension. This is due to an inconsistent behavior of the `PointSkyRegion.contains` method.
A patch has been introduced to correct for that before this is fixed in the `regions` package.

The new `Observation.peek()` methods no longer returns empty panels when some IRF are not available.

Some issues affecting the `SafeMaskMaker` have been corrected as well as a bug of the
`ExcessMapEstimator` appearing when the input `Dataset` had not mask defined.

The folder structure of the documentation has been updated to closely follow the documentation
structure. This corrects some inconsistencies appearing in the lateral table of contents both in
the main documentation and the tutorial pages.
