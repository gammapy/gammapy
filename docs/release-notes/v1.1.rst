Summary
~~~~~~~

This release introduces a number of new features as well as some performance improvements.

Support for energy dependent temporal models is introduced. Only template models are supported.
They use a `RegionNDMap` object with an energy and a time axis. Note that these models
are meant for event simulation with the `MapDatasetEventSampler` and cannot be used
for modeling and fitting.

A tutorial demonstrating how to simulate events using this type of models has been added.

Support for multiprocessing is improved. `FluxPointsEstimator` and `LightCurveEstimator`
can now run on several cores. This is defined with the `n_jobs` parameter that can be set on
init. The backend used by default is the python multiprocessing. This interface is also used
by the `DatasetsMaker` that performs the data reduction loop.

A first step in the separation of the internal data model and the GADF format is introduced
in this release in the handling of the pointing and the GTI. This is part of a larger project
that will be implemented in the coming feature releases to allow I/O with multiple data formats.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*gammapy.data*

- A new function `~gammapy.data.get_irfs_features()` can extract the features of IRFs
  (such as energy resolution bias or PSF radius) of a list of `Observation`. The output
  list can then be passed to the function `~gammapy.utils.cluster.hierarchical_clustering()`
  which will find clusters of IRF features allowing to combine `Observation` with similar
  IRF characteristics during analysis.

*gammapy.maps*

- A `Map.reorder_axes` helper method has been introduced.
- Dot product is now supported with the `Map.dot()` function. It applies the dot product on
  the axes sharing the same name. It can also be called via the `@` operator.
- A `WcsNDMap.to_region_nd_map_histogram()` helper method is introduced to compute
  the histogram of the map values along the spatial dimensions for each non spatial axes
  bins.

*gammapy.modeling*

- The `~gammapy.modeling.models.LightCurveTemplateTemporalModel` now supports energy dependent
  light curve templates. These models are now created from a `Map` object with a `time` axis
  and optionally with an `energy_true` axis. They can be read from an `~astropy.table.Table`
  (only regular light curve models) or from a serialized `Map`. For now, the energy dependent
  models cannot be used for analysis.
- A new function `~gammapy.modeling.select_nested_models` has been introduced to perform
  nested model fits and compute the resulting test statistic (TS) between two nested hypotheses.
  It can be used to determine whether the addition of a source to the model is significant or
  to test for specific features in a model (e.g. test the existence of a spectral cutoff).
- A new method has been added on `SpectralModel.spectral_index_error()` to compute
  the spectral index at a given energy as well as its error by error propagation of
  the covariance matrix elements.
- The Franceschini (2018) and Saldana-Lopez (2021) EBL are now part of the built-ins
  EBL models.
- A spatial correction model can now be added to the `~gammapy.modeling.models.FoVBackgroundModel`.
  It can be used with a new spatial model, the `~gammapy.modeling.models.PiecewiseNormSpatialModel`.


*gammapy.estimators*

- Multiprocessing is now supported for `FluxPointsEstimator` and `LightCurveEstimator`. Setting
  the number of cores used is done with the `n_jobs` property that is available on these
  classes.

*gammapy.visualization*

- A function to plot `Map` as RGB is now proposed: `~gammapy.visualization.plot_map_rgb()`.
- A function to plot the spectral distributions of predicted counts of models defined
  on a `Dataset` is now available : `~gammapy.visualization.plot_npred_signal()`

*documentation*

- A new tutorial to demonstrate how to use Gammapy with HAWC data.
- The pulsar analysis tutorial now shows how to create a `MapDatasetOnOff` using phase
  information.
- A new tutorial demonstrating event sampling with energy dependent temporal models has
  been added.

*infrastructure*

- Deprecation warnings can now be raised by Gammapy deprecated code. The warnings will appear
  in the documentation and docstrings as well. Deprecated features will usually be removed
  in the following feature release.
- Minimal python version is now 3.9. Python 3.10 is supported as well.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

*gammapy.data*

- The `Observation.pointing_radec` and `Observation.pointing_altaz` `Observation.pointing_zen`
  are now deprecated. One should use `Observation.get_pointing_icrs(time)` instead. This approach
  will support different pointing strategies. In most cases, taking the pointing at the mid
  time of an observation is sufficient. This is provided by the property `Observation.tmid`.
- To separate data format and data model and to support observations with fixed pointing,
  the `~gammapy.data.FixedPointingInfo` has been restructured. Most of its properties
  have been deprecated. The main functions are `FixedPointingInfo.get_icrs(time, location)` and
  `FixedPointingInfo.get_altaz(time, location)`
- the `GTI` now consists in a simple `Table` with `START` and `STOP` as `~astropy.time.Time`
  object. `GTI.table` no longer contains a GADF formatted table with columns representing
  start and stop time as METs (Mission Elpased Time). All methods should behave equivalently
  with the same interface.

*gammapy.irf*

- `~gammapy.irf.load_cta_irfs` is now deprecated. Use instead the more general
  `~gammapy.irf.load_irf_dict_from_file`

*gammapy.modeling*

- The `FitResult.iminuit` attribute is now deprecated. It should be accessed from `optimize_result`
  property instead, via: `FitResult.optimize_result.iminuit`.

*gammapy.utils*

- The `~gammapy.utils.table.table_from_row_data()` is now deprecated. It can be simply replaced
  by the regular constructor : `Table(rows)`.

Bug fixes and improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The `Map.fill_events()` method now supports adding weights to the input events.
- The output of the `FitResult` has been clarified in some failure cases.
- The energy dependent RADMAX cut is now supported by the `~gammapy.makers.PhaseBackgroundMaker`.
- A `scale` attribute was added to `TemporalModel` classes. It is used to treat the `t_ref`
  parameter in a consistent manner via a `TemporalModel.reference_time` that converts the
  parameter (defined in mjd) in a proper `~astropy.time.Time`. It avoids comparing
  inconsistent scales when evaluating temporal models.
- The `~gammapy.estimators.TSMapEstimator` now accepts `MapDatasetOnOff` as well
  as regular `MapDataset`.
- `FluxPoints.plot()` now includes a `time_format` argument to adapt the time display in the
  resulting plot (can be either `iso` or `mjd`).
- Units representation in plot labels is improved using `to_sting(latex_inline)`. The default
  behavior can be changed adapting the global variable `UNIT_STRING_FORMAT` defined in
  `~gammapy.maps.axes`.
