Background
==========

As a function of reconstructed energy and detector coordinates (:ref:`gadf:bkg_3d`)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `~gammapy.irf.Background3D` class represents a background rate per solid
angle as a function of reconstructed energy and detector coordinates

Its format specifications are available in :ref:`gadf:bkg_3d`.

This is the format in which IACT DL3 background rates are usually provided, as an example:

As a function of reconstructed energy and offset angle, radially symmetric (:ref:`gadf:bkg_2d`)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `~gammapy.irf.Background2D` class represents a background rate per solid angle
as a function reconstructed energy and offset angle from the field of view center.

Its format specifications are available in :ref:`gadf:bkg_2d`.

You can produce a radially-symmetric background from a list of DL3 observations
devoid of gamma-ray signal using
`this tutorial <https://gammapy.github.io/gammapy-recipes/_build/html/notebooks/background-model/background_model.html>`__
