*************************************************
Utility functions and classes (``gammapy.utils``)
*************************************************

Introduction
============

``gammapy.utils`` is a collection of utility functions that are used in many places
or don't fit in one of the other packages.

Since the various sub-modules of ``gammapy.utils`` are mostly unrelated,
they are not imported into the top-level namespace.
Here are some examples of how to import functionality from the ``gammapy.utils``
sub-modules:

.. code-block:: python

   from gammapy.utils.random import sample_sphere
   sample_sphere(size=10)

   from gammapy.utils import random
   random.sample_sphere(size=10)


.. _time_handling:

Time handling in Gammapy
========================

See `gammapy.utils.time`.

Time format and scale
---------------------

In Gammapy, `astropy.time.Time` objects are used to represent times:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from astropy.time import Time
    >>> Time(['1999-01-01T00:00:00.123456789', '2010-01-01T00:00:00'])
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=['1999-01-01T00:00:00.123' '2010-01-01T00:00:00.000']>

Note that Astropy chose ``format='isot'`` and ``scale='utc'`` as default and in
Gammapy these are also the recommended format and time scale.

.. warning::

   Actually what's written here is not true.
   In CTA it hasn't been decided if times will be in ``utc`` or ``tt`` (terrestial time) format.

   Here's a reminder that this needs to be settled / updated:
   https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/issues/284


When other time formats are needed it's easy to convert, see the
:ref:`time format section and table in the Astropy docs <astropy:time-format>`.

E.g. sometimes in astronomy the modified Julian date ``mjd`` is used and for passing times to matplotlib
for plotting the ``plot_date`` format should be used:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from astropy.time import Time
    >>> time = Time(['1999-01-01T00:00:00.123456789', '2010-01-01T00:00:00'])
    >>> time.mjd
    array([ 51179.00000143,  55197.        ])
    >>> time.plot_date
    array([ 729755.00000143,  733773.        ])

Converting to other time scales is also easy, see the
:ref:`time scale section, diagram and table in the Astropy docs <astropy:time-scale>`.

E.g. when converting celestial (RA/DEC) to horizontal (ALT/AZ) coordinates, the
`sidereal time <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time>`__ is needed.
This is done automatically by `astropy.coordinates.AltAz` when the
`astropy.coordinates.AltAz.obstime` is set with a `~astropy.time.Time` object in any scale,
no need for explicit time scale transformations in Gammapy
(although if you do want to explicitly compute it, it's easy, see `here <http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/time/index.html#sidereal-time>`__).

The "Time Systems in a nutshell" section `here <http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone_Data/Time_in_ScienceTools.html>`__
gives a good, brief explanation of the differences between the relevant time scales ``UT1``, ``UTC`` and ``TT``.

.. _MET_definition:

Mission elapsed times (MET)
---------------------------

[MET]_ time references are times representing UTC seconds after a
specific origin. Each experiment may have a different MET origin
that should be included in the header of the corresponding data
files. For more details see `Cicerone: Data - Time in Fermi Data Analysis
<http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/documentation/Cicerone/Cicerone_Data/
Time_in_ScienceTools.html>`_.

It's not clear yet how to best implement METs in Gammapy, it's one
of the tasks here:
https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/issues/284

For now, we use the `gammapy.time.time_ref_from_dict`, `gammapy.time.time_relative_to_ref`
and `gammapy.time.absolute_time` functions to convert MET floats to `~astropy.time.Time`
objects via the reference times stored in FITS headers.

Time differences
----------------

TODO: discuss when to use `~astropy.time.TimeDelta` or `~astropy.units.Quantity` or [MET]_ floats and
where one needs to convert between those and what to watch out for.


.. _energy_handling_gammapy:

Energy handling in Gammapy
==========================

Basics
------

Most objects in Astronomy require an energy axis, e.g. counts spectra or
effective area tables. In general, this axis can be defined in two ways.

* As an array of energy values. E.g. the Fermi-LAT diffuse flux is given at
  certain energies and those are stored in an ENERGY FITS table extension.
  In Gammalib this is represented by GEnergy.
* As an array of energy bin edges. This is usually stored in EBOUNDS tables,
  e.g. for Fermi-LAT counts cubes. In Gammalib this is represented by GEbounds.

In Gammapy both the use cases are handled by two seperate classes:
`gammapy.utils.energy.Energy` for energy values and
`gammapy.utils.energy.EnergyBounds` for energy bin edges

Energy
------

The Energy class is a subclass of `~astropy.units.Quantity` and thus has the
same functionality plus some convenience functions for fits I/O

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from gammapy.utils.energy import Energy
    >>> energy = Energy([1,2,3], 'TeV')
    >>> hdu = energy.to_fits()
    >>> type(hdu)
    <class 'astropy.io.fits.hdu.table.BinTableHDU'>

EnergyBounds
------------

The EnergyBounds class is a subclass of Energy. Additional functions are available
e.g. to compute the bin centers

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from gammapy.utils.energy import EnergyBounds
    >>> ebounds = EnergyBounds.equal_log_spacing(1, 10, 8, 'GeV')
    >>> ebounds.size
    9
    >>> ebounds.nbins
    8
    >>> center = ebounds.log_centers
    >>> center
    <Energy [ 1.15478198, 1.53992653, 2.05352503, 2.73841963, 3.65174127,
              4.86967525, 6.49381632, 8.65964323] GeV>
