Introduction
============
`~gammapy.time.period` establishes methods for period detection in unevenly sampled time series.
It compute the periodogram and the spectral window function of a light curve.
A single sinusoidal is fitted with linear (`~gammapy.time.period.lomb_scargle`)
or robust (`~gammapy.time.period.robust_periodogram`) least square regression to the light curve.
The period of the highest periodogram peak is returned as the period of an intrinsic periodic beahviour.
The false alarm probability of this period is estimated under the null hypothesis of only-noise data.
The results can be plotted with `gammapy.time.plot_periodogram`.
The Lomb Scargle algorithm is provided by `astropy.stats.LombScargle`.
See the astropy docs for more details about the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and its false alarm probability [1]_.
The loss functions for the robust regression are provided by `scipy.optimize.least_squares`.
See the scipy docs for more details about the loss functions [2]_.

Getting Started
===============
Input
-----
`~gammapy.time.period` takes a light curve in format `time`, `flux` and `flux error` as input.
The trial period grid can optionally be specified by the resolution `dt` and a maximum period `max_period`.
If these parameters are not given, `dt` will be set by the inverse Nyquist frequency
and `max_period` by the length of the light curve.
For the robust periodogram, the loss function `loss` and the loss scale parameter `scale` need to be given.
For the false alarm probability, distributions can be chosen from `criteria`.
If not specified, all criteria will be used for the analysis.
For the bootstrap resamling, the number of resamlings can be defined by `n_bootstrap`.
Its default value is set to 100.
`~gammapy.time.plot_periodogram` takes the output of `~gammapy.time.period` as input.


Output
------

`~gammapy.time.period` returns the period grid, the periodogram peaks of the
Lomb-Scargle periodogram and the spectral window function,
the false alarm probability for the highest periodogram peak for the given criteria,
as well as the period of highest periodogram peak.

Example
=======
An example of detecting a period with the Lomb-Scargle is shown in the figure below.
The code can be found under [3]_.
The light curve is from the X-ray binary LS 5039 observed with H.E.S.S. at energies above 0.1 TeV in 2005 [4]_.
The Lomb-Scargle reveals the period of :math:`(3.907 \pm 0.001)` days in agreement with [4]_ and [5]_.

The maximum false alarm probability of the highest periodogram peak is estimated to 0.17 with the `cvm` criterion.
The false alarm probability (FAP) of all criteria is listed below:

=========  ========
criterion  FAP
=========  ========
`pre`      1.11e-12
`cvm`      0.17
`nll`      0.12
`boot`     0.0
=========  ========

As can be seen, `cvm` is the most constraining criterion.
`boot` is to imprecise to return a vaild false alarm probability for 100 bootstrap resamplings.

The parameter `max_period` was set to :math:`10 d` to decrease computation time by limiting the period range for the analysis.
The periodogram has many spurious peaks, which are due to several factors:

1. Errors in observations lead to leakage of power from the true peaks.
2. The signal is not a perfect sinusoid, so additional peaks can indicate higher-frequency components in the signal.
3. The spectral window function shows two prominent peaks around one and 27 days.
   The first one arises from the nightly observation cycle, the second from the lunar phase.
   Thus, aliases are expected to appear at :math:`f_{{alias}} = f_{{true}} + n f_{{window}}`
   for integer values of :math:`n`. For the peak in the spectral window function at
   :math:`f_{{window}} = 1 d^{{-1}}`, this corresponds to the second highest peak in
   the periodogram at :math:`p_{{alias}} = 0.796`.
