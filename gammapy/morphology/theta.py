    Notes
    If you have to compute theta or containment many times for
    the same dist, this is much faster than ThetaCalculatorScipy.
    If you want only one value it could actually be slower,
    especially the containment calculation.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Distribution function dp / dtheta2 (theta2)
    theta_max : float
        Integration range will be 0 .. theta_max ^ 2
    nbins : int

    It is more precise than ThetaCalculator and doesn't

    gives your desired precision.
    If you have to compute many thetas this can be quite slow
    because it is a root finding with nested integration.

    Typically this method is used for PSF-convolved
    model images, where analytical distributions or
    1D distributions are not available.

    @note: The theta and containment is calculated relative
    to the origin (x, y) = (0, 0).

    @note: We do simple bin summing. In principle we could
    do integration over bins by using scipy.integrate.dblquad
    in combination with e.g. scipy.interpolate.interp2d,
    but for the speed / precision we need this is overkill.

    @todo: I just realized that probably the best thing to
    do is to bin (x,y) -> theta2, make a spline interpolation
    and then call ThetaCalculatorScipy!
