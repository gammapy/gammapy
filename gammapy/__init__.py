"""Gammapy: A Python package for gamma-ray astronomy.

* Code: https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy
* Docs: https://docs.gammapy.org/

The top-level `gammapy` namespace is almost empty,
it only contains this:

::

 test              --- Run Gammapy unit tests
 __version__       --- Gammapy version string


The Gammapy functionality is available for import from
the following sub-packages (e.g. `gammapy.makers`):

::

 astro        --- Astrophysical source and population models
 catalog      --- Source catalog tools
 makers       --- Data reduction functionality
 data         --- Data and observation handling
 irf          --- Instrument response functions (IRFs)
 maps         --- Sky map data structures
 modeling     --- Models and fitting
 estimators   --- High level flux estimation
 stats        --- Statistics tools
 utils        --- Utility functions and classes
