def exptest(time_delta):
    """Compute the level of variability for a certain period of time.

    The level of variability is quantified by ``mr``, as defined in Prahl (1999).

    For constant rate events, it follows a standard normal distribution,
    i.e. it can be used directly as the significance of variability.

    For example usage, see :ref:`time-variability`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time_delta : array-like
        Time differences between consecutive events

    Returns
    -------
    mr : float
        Level of variability
