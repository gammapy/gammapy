Introduction
============


The following three tutorials show different ways of how to use Gammapy to perform a complete data analysis,
from data selection to data reduction and finally modeling and fitting.

The first tutorial is an overview on how to perform a standard analysis workflow using the high level interface
in a configuration-driven approach, whilst the second deals with the same use-case using the low level API
and showing what is happening *under-the-hood*. The third tutorial shows a glimpse of how to handle different
basic data structures like event lists, source catalogs, sky maps, spectral models and flux points tables.
