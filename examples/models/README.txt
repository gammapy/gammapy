Model gallery
=============

The model gallery provides a visual overview of the available models in Gammapy. In general
the models are grouped into the following categories:

- `~gammapy.modeling.models.SpectralModel`: models to describe spectral shapes of sources
- `~gammapy.modeling.models.SpatialModel`: models to describe spatial shapes (morphologies) of sources
- `~gammapy.modeling.models.TemporalModel`: models to describe temporal flux evolution of sources, such as light and phase curves

The models follow a naming scheme which contains the category as a suffix to the class name.
