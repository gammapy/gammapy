Naima spectral model
====================

This class provides an interface with the models defined in the naima models module.

The model accepts as a positional argument a `Naima <https://naima.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
radiative `~naima.models` instance, used to compute the non-thermal emission from populations of
relativistic electrons or protons due to interactions with the ISM or with radiation and magnetic fields.

One of the advantages provided by this class consists in the possibility of performing a maximum
likelihood spectral fit of the model's parameters directly on observations, as opposed to the MCMC
`fit to flux points <https://naima.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mcmc.html>`_ featured in
Naima. All the parameters defining the parent population of charged particles are stored as
`~gammapy.modeling.Parameter` and left free by default. In case that the radiative model is
`~naima.radiative.Synchrotron`, the magnetic field strength may also be fitted. Parameters can be
freezed/unfreezed before the fit, and maximum/minimum values can be set to limit the parameters space to
the physically interesting region.

# Example plot

# Here we create and plot a spectral model that convolves an `~gammapy.modeling.models.ExpCutoffPowerLawSpectralModel`
# electron distribution with an `InverseCompton` radiative model, in the presence of multiple seed photon fields.
