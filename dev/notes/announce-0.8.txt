Title: Gammapy 0.8 release


Dear colleagues,

we are happy to announce the release of Gammapy 0.8.

Gammapy is an open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy built on Numpy and Astropy.
It is a prototype for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) science tools,
and can also be used to analyse data from existing gamma-ray telescopes.

This release contains a big change: the new gammapy.maps is used for all
map-based analysis (2D images and 3D cubes with an energy axis). It also
contains a first version of new classes for modeling and fitting of 3D cubes.
Please see the tutorial notebooks to learn about the new maps and modeling.
If you have any issues or questions, please get in touch!
