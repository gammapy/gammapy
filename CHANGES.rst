**What's new**

Gammapy v0.18 comes with many new features, further unified API, bug fixes
and improved performance.

For Gammapy v0.18 the handling of the instrumental background was refactored
by introducing a ``FoVBackgroundModel`` which is specific to each ``MapDataset``.
Instead of relying on the previous ``BackgroundModel``, which coupled
the map template and spectral parameters, the information is now split such that
``MapDataset.background`` contains the map template and the ``FoVBackgroundModel``
the corresponding parameters, respectively. The model corrected background can now be
accessed via ``MapDataset.npred_background()``. By default the un-corrected
background map is now added to the predicted counts. The consistent behaviour
has been implemented on the ``MapDatasetOnOff``.

The ``FoVBackgroundModel`` has support for a ``spectral_model`` argument, which
allows different background corrections using different "norm" spectral models
(see below).

The definition of the quantities defined on ``MapDataset`` and ``MapDatasetOnOff``
as well as the corresponding attributes on the ``CountsStatistics`` has been
improved in the stats definition table :ref:`stats_notation`.

Many additional methods to modify the data have been added to the ``MapDataset``
and ``SpectrumDataset``. This includes ``.downsample()``, ``.pad()``,
``.resample_energy_axis()``, ``.slice_by_energy()`` ``.slice_by_idx()``.
The models definition in the dataset is now reset consistently in all of the
listed methods. The information returned by ``.info_dict()`` has been
unified. The information contained in ``.meta_table`` is now handled correctly
during stacking of datasets.


Following the proposal in `PIG 21`_ Gammapy v0.18 comes with many improvements
to the ``gammapy.modeling.models`` sub-package. This includes the introduction
of "norm" spectral models, which are multiplicative models to used with spatial
and spectral template or parametric models. Among those are a
``PowerLawNormSpectralModel``, ``LogParabolaNormSpectralModel`` and
``PiecewiseNormSectralModel``. The EBL absorption was refactored
accordingly to an ``EBLAbsorptionNormSpectralModel``. A new
``GeneralizedGaussianSpatialModel`` and ``BrokenPowerlawSpectralModel``
have been introduced.

Gammapy v0.18 comesnow with support for custom energy dependent spatial models.
An example for this can be found in the `models tutorial <tutorials/models.html>`__.
The ``SkyDiffuseCube`` has been removed, the same functionality can now be
achieved with the ``TemplateSpatialModel``. Following the proposal in
`PIG 21`_, short YAML tags were introduced for all models. An overview of the
tags can be found in a table in the linked PIG document.

For Gammapy v0.18 the stacking behaviour of the ``EDispKernelMap`` was fixed.
it now handles safe energy threshold for stacked analyses correctly.
The ``MapDataset.edisp`` attribute has been changed to this class by default.
The ``IRFStacker`` class has been removed.

The ``Estimator``` API has been homogenized, in particular, they now support
the definition of energy edges on init. This means light-curves, excess maps,
excess profiles and ts maps can be computed in energy bins with the same API.
The ``LightCurveEstimator`` was refactored to rely on the same algorithm
as the ``FluxPointsEstimator``. It now also fits the data in the provided
energy range.

The ``Map`` class now supports boolean and comparator operations, such as
``>,<,&,|`` etc. . A convenience ``Map.interp_to_geom()`` has been added.

A ``Fit.stat_surface()`` method was introduced which allows to compute a
fit statistic surface. In addition an option to store the trace of the fit was
added. Both are demonstrated in dedicated sections in the `modeling and fitting tutorial <tutorials/modeling.html>`__

Following the proposal in `PIG 19`_, the ``gammapy.time`` sub-package was removed.
All functionality related to light curves can be found in ``gammapy.estimators``.
The Feldman-Cousins method has been removed from the ``gammapy.stats``.

Gammapy v0.18 comes with an improved performance related to caching the computation
of predicted counts and caching of psf convolution. In Gammapy v0.18 the support
for Numpy<1.17 had been dropped.

0.17 (Apr 1, 2020)
------------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released April 1, 2020
- 8 contributors

**What's new**

Gammapy v0.17 comes with new important features, an improved sub-package
stucture and a more uniform API. Again this release contains several API
breaking changes and removal of non-essential parts of Gammapy. These
changes are required to finally arrive at a more consistent and stable
API for Gammapy v1.0.

The main feature introduces in Gammapy v0.17 is event sampling. Based
on the newly introduced ``MapDatasetEventSampler`` class, event lists can be
sampled from a ``MapDataset`` object. The use of this class is shown in a dedicated
`event sampling tutorial <tutorials/event_sampling.html>`__. Gammapy v0.17 now
supports simulation and fitting of temporal models. Both are demonstrated in the
`lightcurve simulation tutorial <tutorials/light_curve_simulation.html>`__.
A more general introduction to modeling and fitting in Gammapy is now available
as a `modeling and fitting tutorial <tutorials/modeling.html>`__

Following the proposal in `PIG 19`_ the sub-package structure of Gammapy was
unified. Instead of grouping the main functionality by use-case it is now
grouped by abstractions and data levels. For this all ``Dataset`` classes
were moved to the newly introduced `gammapy.datasets`. All ``Maker`` classes
for data reduction from the DL3 to the DL4 data level were moved to the new
`gammapy.makers` sub-package and all high level ``Estimator`` classes were moved
to the new `gammapy.estimators`. In addition a `gammapy.visualization` module
was introduced to group plotting related functionality into a single namespace.
The `gammapy.cube`, `gammapy.spectrum` and `gammapy.detect` modules were removed.

With the introduction of the `gammapy.estimators` sub-package the
API of all ``Estimator`` classes was unified. The ``Dataset`` objects
are now always passed to the ``.run()`` methods. A new ``ExcessMapEstimator``
was introduced, which replaces the former ``compute_lima_map`` functions
and also computes maps of upper limits as well as asymmetric flux errors.
The ``TSMapEstimator`` now takes into account PSF information automatically
and uses `SkyModel` as kernel configuration.

For Gammapy v0.17 the model handling was further improved and unified. The
separate ``background_model`` argument was removed from the ``MapDataset``.
Background models can now be specified as part of the general model
definition. For this a ``BackgroundModel.datasets_names`` attribute
was introduced which allows to declare to which dataset the model belongs.
The application of PSF and energy dispersion can now be configured per model
component using the newly introduced ``SkyModel.apply_irf`` and ``SkyDiffuseCube.apply_irf``
keywords. A new ``GaussianTemporalModel`` and ``ExpDecayTemporalModel`` were
introduced.

A new ``Covariance`` class was introduced and the covariance information was
moved from the ``Parameters`` object to a ``.covariance`` attribute on all
``Model`` and ``Models`` objects.  The covariance and is now automatically
set after ``Fit.covariance()`` was called.

To unify and clean up statistical calculations ``CountsStatistics`` classes
we introduced in ``gammapy.stats`` which allow calculation of excess, background,
significance, errors, asymmetric errors and upper limits. The ``gammapy.stats.poisson``
module has been removed as well as the ``significance_lima`` methods.

To further unify the data structures for 1D and 3D analyses a ``RegionGeom``
and ``RegionNDMap`` were introduced in ``gammapy.maps``. These region based map classes
are now used for the ``SpectrumDataset`` and ``SpectrumDatasetOnOff``. The previously
used ``CountsSpectrum`` class was removed.

0.16 (Feb 1, 2020)
-------------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released Feb 1, 2020
- 8 contributors
- 61 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new**

For Gammapy v0.16 a ``FoVBackgroundMaker`` was implemented, which supports
different methods of adapting the norm and tilt of a field of view background
model to the data.

To provide a visual overview of the available models in Gammapy a
`model gallery <modeling/gallery/index.rst>`__ was added. A general introduction
on how to work with the different models is now available in a dedicated `models tutorial <tutorials/models.html>`__.
The spectral analysis of an extended source is demonstrated in the newly
added `extended source spectral analysis tutorial <tutorials/extended_source_spectral_analysis.ipynb>`__.

To further improve API consistency the ``EnergyDispersion`` class
was renamed to ``EDispKernel`` and the ``SkyModels`` class was
renamed to a more general ``Models`` class.

The ``coordsys`` attribute of ``WcsGeom`` and ``HpxGeom`` was
renamed to ``frame`` and now supports arbitrary Astropy coordinate
frames.

The ``Datasets`` and ``Models`` container objects now require unique
names of the objects contained. By default unique identifiers are generated
in the model and dataset objects. The ``Datasets``, ``Models`` as well
as ``Observations`` container classes, were extended to now support
in place ``.append()``, ``.extend()`` and ``.insert()`` operations.

For Gammapy v0.16 the API of the ``SensitivityEstimator`` and ``TSMapEstimator``
was adapted to take a ``MapDataset`` or ``MapDatasetOnOff`` as input.
The ``ASmooth`` class was renamed to ``ASmoothMapEstimator`` and also
adapted to work with ``MapDataset`` and ``MapDatasetOnOff``.

Again this release contains several API breaking changes and removal of
non-essential parts of Gammapy (see PR list below). These changes are
required to finally arrive at a more consistent and stable API for
Gammapy v1.0. Thanks for your understanding!

0.15 (Dec 3, 2019)
------------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released Dec 3, 2019
- 12 contributors
- 187 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new**

For Gammapy v0.15 the high level ``Analysis`` class was moved to the newly
introduced ``gammapy.analysis`` sub-package. The syntax of the YAML config
file was simplified and validation of config parameters is now available
for interactive use of the ``Analysis`` class as well. Both is demonstrated in the
`first analysis with Gammapy notebook <tutorials/analysis_1.html>`__.
In addition a new ``gammapy analysis`` command line tool was introduced,
which executes the data reduction part of an analysis, based on a given config
file.

Following the proposal in `PIG 18`_ the structure of the documentation was
improved. The new `overview page <overview.rst>`__ gives an introduction and
overview of the Gammapy analysis workflow and package structure. The structure
and content of the `tutorials page <tutorials/index.rst>`__ was simplified and
cleaned up and a `how to <howto.rst>`__ page was introduced. A tutorial notebook
showing how to do a joint `multi-instrument analysis <tutorials/analysis_mwl.html>`__
of the Crab Nebula using H.E.S.S. and Fermi-LAT data and HAWC flux points was added.

Another focus of the work for Gammapy v0.15 was the clean-up and unification of
the spectrum and map data reduction. Gammapy now features a ``MapDatasetMaker``,
and ``SpectrumDatasetMaker`` which directly produce a ``MapDataset`` or
``SpectrumDataset`` from DL3 data. The existing background estimation classes
were adapted by introducing a ``ReflectedRegionsBackgroundMaker``,
``RingBackgroundMaker`` and ``AdaptiveRingbackgroundMaker``. Those makers can
also be chained to create custom data reduction workflows. The new data reduction
API is shown in the `second analysis with Gammapy notebook <tutorials/analysis_2.html>`__
and corresponding `docs page <cube/index.rst>`__.

A ``MapDatasetOnOff`` class was introduced to handle on-off observation based analyses
and as a container for image based ring-background estimation. All datasets now
have a ``.create()`` method to allow an easy creation of the dataset from a map
geometry or energy specification. Gammapy now supports spatially varying PSF and
energy dispersion in the data reduction as well as during fitting. By introducing
an in memory ``Observation`` class Gammapy now features unified support for
binned simulations of spectrum and map datasets. This is shown in the
`1d simulation <tutorials/spectrum_simulation.html>`__ and
`3d simulation <tutorials/simulate_3d.html>`__ tutorial notebooks.

The ``LightCurveEstimator`` was improved to use the GTIs defined on datasets
and allow for grouping of datasets according to provided time intervals. Details
are explained on the `time docs page <time/index.rst>`__ and the newly added
`flare light curve notebook <tutorials/light_curve_flare.html>`__.

The support for 2FHL and 4FGL was improved by adding attributes returning
spatial and spectral models as well as lightcurves to the corresponding objects.
The support for the Fermi-LAT 1FHL catalog was dropped. An overview can be found
on the `catalog docs page <catalog/index.rst>`__ and the `catalog tutorial notebook
<tutorials/catalog.html>`__.

Error propagation is now fully supported for the ``AbsorbedSpectralModel`` and
``NaimaModel``.

For this release the dependency on ``reproject`` and ``jsonschema`` was dropped. The
latter was replaced by a new dependency on ``pydantic``. This release contains
several API breaking changes and removal of non-essential parts of Gammapy
(see PR list below). These changes are required to finally arrive at a more
consistent and stable API for Gammapy v1.0. Thanks for your understanding!

0.14 (Sep 30, 2019)
-------------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released Sep 30, 2019
- 8 contributors
- 101 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new**

Gammapy v0.14 features a new high level analysis interface. Starting from
a YAML configuration file, it supports the standard use-cases of joint
or stacked 3D as well as 1D reflected region analyses. It also supports
computation of flux points for all cases. The usage of this new ``Analysis``
class is demonstrated in the `hess.html <./tutorials/hess.html>`__ tutorial.

Following the proposal in :ref:`pig-016` the subpackages ``gammapy.background``
and ``gammapy.image`` were removed. Existing functionality was moved to the
``gammapy.cube`` and ``gammapy.spectrum`` subpackages.

A new subpackage ``gammapy.modeling`` subpackage as introduced. All spectral,
spatial, temporal and combined models were moved to the new namespace and
renamed following a consistent naming scheme. This provides a much clearer
structure of the model types and hierarchy for users.

The ``SkyEllipse`` model was removed. Instead the ``GaussianSpatialModel``
as well as the ``DiskSpatialModel`` now support parameters for
elongation. A bug that lead to an incorrect flux normalization of the
``PointSpatialModel`` at high latitudes was fixed. The default coordinate
frame for all spatial models was changed to ``icrs``. A new
``ConstantTemporalModel`` was introduced.

A new ``MapDataset.to_spectrum_dataset()`` method allows to reduce a map
dataset to a spectrum dataset in a specified analysis region. The
``SpectrumDatasetOnOffStacker`` was removed and placed by a ``SpectrumDatasetOnOff.stack()``
and ``Datasets.stack_reduce()`` method. A ``SpectrumDataset.stack()``
method was also added.

Following :ref:`pig-013` the support for Python 3.5 was dropped with Gammapy v0.14.
At the same time the versions of the required dependencies were updated to
Numpy 1.16, Scipy 1.2, Astropy 3.2, Regions 0.5, Pyyaml 5.1, Click 7.0 and
Jsonschema 3.0.

-------------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released Jul 26, 2019
- 15 contributors
- 2 months of work
- 72 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new**

The Gammapy v0.13 release includes many bug-fixes, a lot of clean-up work
and some new features.

Gammapy v0.13 implements a new ``SpectralGaussian`` and ``PLSuperExpCutoff4FGL``
model. To support binned simulation of counts data in a uniform
way ``MapDataset.fake()``, ``SpectrumDataset.fake()`` and ``SpectrumDatasetOnOff.fake()``
methods were implemented, which simulate binned counts maps and spectra from models.
In addition a nice string representations for all of the dataset classes was implemented
together with convenience functions to compute residuals using different methods on all
of them. The algorithm and API of the current ``LightCurveEstimator`` was changed to
use datasets. Now it is possible to compute lightcurves using spectral as well
as cube based analyses. The definition of the position angle of the ``SkyEllipse`` model
was changed to follow IAU conventions.

The handling of sky regions in Gammapy was unified as described in `PIG 10`_.
For convenience regions can now also be created from DS9 region strings. The clean-up
process of ``gammapy.spectrum`` was continued by removing the ``PHACountsSpectrum``
class, which is now fully replaced by the ``SpectrumDatasetOnOff`` class. The
``Energy`` and ``EnergyBounds`` classes were also removed. Grids of energies can be
created and handled directly using the ``MapAxis`` object now.

The algorithm to compute solid angles for maps was fixed, so that it gives correct
results for WCS projections even with high spatial distortions. Standard analyses
using TAN or CAR projections are only affected on a <1% level. Different units
for the energy axis of the counts and exposure map in a ``MapDataset`` are now
handled correctly.

The recommended conda environment for Gammapy v0.13 was updated. It now relies
on Python 3.7, Ipython 7.5, Scipy 1.3, Matplotlib 3.1, Astropy 3.1, and Healpy 1.12.
These updates should be backwards compatible. Sripts and notebooks should
run and give the same results.

**What's new**

For Gammapy v0.12 we did our homework, cleaned up the basement and emptied the
trash bin. It is a maintenance release that does not introduce many new features,
but where we have put a lot of effort into integrating the ``gammapy.spectrum``
submodule into the datasets framework we introduced in the previous Gammapy version.
For this we replaced the former ``SpectrumObservation`` class by a new ``SpectrumDatasetOnOff``
class, which now works with the general ``Fit`` and ``Datasets`` objects in
``gammapy.utils.fitting``. This also enabled us to remove the ``SpectrumObservationList``
and ``SpectrumFit`` classes. We adapted the ``SpectrumExtraction`` class accordingly.
We also refactored the ``NDData`` class to use ``MapAxis`` to handle the data axes. This
affects the ``CountsSpectrum`` and the IRF classes in ``gammapy.irf``.

In addition we changed the ``FluxPointsEstimator`` to work with the new ``SpectrumDatasetOnOff``
as well as the ``MapDataset``. Now it is possible to compute flux points for 1D
as well 3D data with a uniform API. We added a new ``NaimaModel`` wrapper class (https://naima.readthedocs.io/),
which allows you to fit true physical, spectral models directly to counts based
gamma-ray data. To improve the fit convergence of the ``SkyDisk`` and ``SkyEllipse``
models we introduced a new parameter defining the slope of the edge of these models.

If you would like to know how to adapt your old spectral analysis scripts to Gammapy
v0.12, please checkout the updated tutorial notebooks (https://docs.gammapy.org/0.12/tutorials.html)
and `get in contact with us <https://gammapy.org/contact.html>`__ anytime if you need help.

**What's new?**

Gammapy v0.11 implements a large part of the new joint-likelihood fitting
framework proposed in `PIG 8 - datasets`_ . This includes the introduction of the
``FluxPointsDataset``, ``MapDataset`` and ``Datasets`` classes, which now represent
the main interface to the ``Fit`` class and fitting backends in Gammapy. As a
first use-case of the new dataset classes we added a tutorial demonstrating a
joint-likelihood fit of a CTA 1DC Galactic center observations. We also
considerably improved the performance of the 3D likelihood evaluation by
evaluating the source model components on smaller cutouts of the map.
We also added a tutorial demonstrating the use of the ``MapDataset`` class for
MCMC sampling and show how to interface Gammapy to the widely used emcee package.
Gammapy v0.11 also includes a new pulsar analysis tutorial. It demonstrates
how to compute phase curves and phase resolved sky maps with Gammapy.
To better support classical analysis methods in our main API we implemented
a ``MapMakerRing`` class, that provides ring and adaptive ring background
estimation for map and image estimation.

Gammapy v0.11 improves the support for the scipy and sherpa fitting backends. It
now implements full support of parameter freezing and parameter limits for both
backends. We also added a ``reoptimize`` option to the ``Fit.likelihood_profile``
method to compute likelihood profiles with reoptimizing remaining free parameters.

For Gammapy v0.11 we added a ``SkyEllipse`` model to support fitting of elongated
sources and changed the parametrization of the ``SkyGaussian`` to integrate correctly
on the sphere. The spatial model classes now feature simple support for coordinate
frames, such that the position of the source can be defined and fitted independently
of the coordinate system of the data. Gammapy v0.11 now supports the evaluation
non-radially symmetric 3D background models and defining multiple background models
for a single ``MapDataset``.

Gammapy v0.11 drops support for Python 2.7, only Python 3.5 or newer is supported (see `PIG 3`_).
If you have any questions or need help to install Python 3, or to update your
scripts and notebooks to work in Python 3, please contact us any time on the
Gammapy mailing list or Slack. We apologise for the disruption and are happy to
help with this transition. Note that Gammapy v0.10 will remain available and is
Python 2 compatible forever, so sticking with that version might be an option
in some cases. pip and conda should handle this correctly, i.e. automatically
pick the last compatible version (Gammapy v0.10) on Python 2, or if you try
to force installation of a later version by explicitly giving a version number,
emit an error and exit without installing or updating.

For Gammapy v0.11 we removed the unmaintained ``gammapy.datasets`` sub-module.
Please use the ``gammapy download`` command to download datasets instead and
the ``$GAMMAPY_DATA`` environment variable to access the data directly from
your local gammapy-datasets folder.

0.10 (Jan 28, 2019)
-------------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released Jan 28, 2019
- 7 contributors
- 2 months of work
- 30 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new?**

Gammapy v0.10 is a small release. An option to have a background model with
parameters such as normalization and spectral tilt was added. The curated
example datasets were improved, the ``gammapy download`` script and access of
example data from the tutorials via the ``GAMMAPY_DATA`` environment variable
were improved. A notebook ``image_analysis`` showing how to use Gammapy to make
and model 2D images for a given given energy band, as a special case of the
existing 3D map-based analysis was added.

A lot of the work recently went into planning the work ahead for 2019. See the
`Gammapy 1.0 roadmap`_ and the `PIG 7 - models`_ as well as `PIG 8 - datasets`_
and get in touch if you want to contribute. We plan to ship a first version of
the new datasets API in Gammapy v0.11 in March 2019.

Gammapy v0.10 is the last Gammapy release that supports Python 2 (see `PIG 3`_).
If you have any questions or need help to install Python 3, or to update your
scripts and notebooks to work in Python 3, please contact us any time on the
Gammapy mailing list or Slack. We apologise for the disruption and are happy to
help with this transition.

pyyaml is now a core dependency of Gammapy, i.e. will always be automatically
installed as a dependency. Instructions for installing Gammapy on Windows, and
continuous testing on Windows were improved.

0.9 (Nov 29, 2018)
------------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released Nov 29, 2018
- 9 contributors (3 new)
- 2 months of work
- 88 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new?**

Gammapy v0.9 comes just two months after v0.8. This is following the `Gammapy
1.0 roadmap`_, Gammapy will from now on have bi-monthly releases, as we work
towards the Gammapy 1.0 release in fall 2019.

Gammapy v0.9 contains many fixes, and a few new features. Big new features
like observation event and time filters, background model classes, as well as
support for fitting joint datasets will come in spring 2019.

The ``FluxPointEstimator`` has been rewritten, and the option to compute
spectral likelihood profiles has been added. The background and diffuse model
interpolation in energy has been improved to be more accurate. The
``gammapy.utils.fitting`` backend is under heavy development, most of the
functionality of MINUIT (covariance, confidence intervals, profiles, contours)
can now be obtained from any ``Fit`` class (spectral or map analysis). Maps now
support arithmetic operators, so that you can e.g. write ``residual = counts -
model`` if ``counts`` and ``model`` are maps containing observed and model
counts.

Gammapy v0.9 now requires Astropy 2.0 or later, and Scipy was changed from
status of optional to required dependency, since currently it is required for
most analysis tasks (e.g. using interpolation when evaluating instrument
responses). Please also note that we have a `plan to drop Python 2.7 support`_
in Gammapy v0.11 in March 2019. If you have any questions or concerns about
moving your scripts and notebooks to Python 3, or need Python 2 support with
later Gammapy releases in 2019, please let us know!

0.8 (Sep 23, 2018)

Summary
+++++++

- Released Sep 23, 2018
- 24 contributors (6 new)
- 7 months of work

**What's new?**

Gammapy v0.8 features major updates to maps and modeling, as well as
installation and how to get started with tutorial notebooks. It also contains
many smaller additions, as well as many fixes and improvements.

The new ``gammapy.maps`` is now used for all map-based analysis (2D images and
3D cubes with an energy axis). The old SkyImage and SkyCube classes have been
removed. All code and documentation has been updated to use ``gammapy.maps``. To
learn about the new maps classes, see the ``intro_maps`` tutorial at
:ref:`tutorials` and the :ref:`gammapy.maps <maps>` documentation page.

The new ``gammapy.utils.fitting`` contains a simple modeling and fitting
framework, that allows the use of ``iminuit`` and ``sherpa`` optimisers as
"backends" for any fit in Gammapy. The classes in ``gammapy.spectrum.models`` (1D
spectrum models) are updated, and ``gammapy.image.models`` (2D spatial models) and
``gammapy.cube.models`` (3D cube models) was added. The ``SpectrumFit`` class was
updated and a ``MapFit`` to fit models to maps was added. This part of Gammapy
remains work in progress, some changes and major improvements are planned for
the coming months.

With Gammapy v0.8, we introduce the ``gammapy download`` command to download
tutorial notebooks and example datasets. A step by step guide is here:
:ref:`getting-started`. Previously tutorial notebooks were maintained in a
separate ``gammapy-extra`` repository, which was inconvenient for users to clone
and use, and more importantly wasn't version-coupled with the Gammapy code
repository, causing major issues in this phase where Gammapy is still under
heavy development.

The recommended way to install Gammapy (described at :ref:`getting-started`) is
now to use conda and to create an environment with dependencies pinned to fixed
versions to get a consistent and reproducible environment. E.g. the Gammapy v0.8
environment uses Python 3.6, Numpy 1.15 and Astropy 3.0. As before, Gammapy is
compatible with a wide range of versions of Numpy and Astropy from the past
years and many installation options are available for Gammapy (e.g. pip or
Macports) in addition to conda. But we wanted to offer this new "stable
recommended environment" option for Gammapy as a default.

The new ``analysis_3d`` notebook shows how to run a 3D analysis for IACT data
using the ``MapMaker`` and ``MapFit`` classes. The ``simulate_3d`` shows how to
simulate and fit a source using CTA instrument response functions. The
simulation is done on a binned 3D cube, not via unbinned event sampling. The
``fermi_lat`` tutorial shows how to analyse high-energy Fermi-LAT data with
events, exposure and PSF pre-computed using the Fermi science tools. The
``hess`` and ``light_curve`` tutorial show how to analyse data from the recent
first H.E.S.S. test data release. You can find these tutorials and more at
:ref:`tutorials`.

Another addition in Gammapy v0.8 is :ref:`gammapy.astro.darkmatter
<astro-darkmatter>`, which contains spatial and spectral models commonly used in
dark matter searches using gamma-ray data.

The number of optional dependencies used in Gammapy has been reduced. Sherpa is
now an optional fitting backend, modeling is built-in in Gammapy. The following
packages are no longer used in Gammapy: scikit-image, photutils, pandas, aplpy.
The code quality and test coverage in Gammapy has been improved a lot.

This release also contains a large number of small improvements and bug fixes to
the existing code, listed below in the changelog.

We are continuing to develop Gammapy at high speed, significant improvements on
maps and modeling, but also on the data and IRF classes are planned for the
coming months and the v0.9 release in fall 2019. We apologise if you are already
using Gammapy for science studies and papers and have to update your scripts and
notebooks to work with the new Gammapy version. If possible, stick with a given
stable version of Gammapy. If you update to a newer version, let us know if you
have any issues or questions. We're happy to help!

Gammapy v0.8 works on Linux, MacOS and Windows, with Python 3.5, 3.6 as well as
legacy Python 2.7.

0.7 (Feb 28, 2018)

Summary
+++++++

- Released Feb 28, 2018
- 25 contributors (16 new)
- 10 months of work
- 178 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new?**

Installation:

- Gammapy 0.7 supports legacy Python 2.7, as well as Python 3.5 and 3.6.
  If you are still using Python 2.7 with Gammapy, please update to Python 3. Let
  us know if you need any help with the update, or are blocked from updating for
  some reason, by filling out the 1-minute `Gammapy installation questionnaire`_
  form. This will help us make a plan how to finish the Python 2 -> 3 transition
  and to set a timeline (`PIG 3`_).
- The Gammapy conda packages are now distributed via the ``conda-forge`` channel,
  i.e. to install or update Gammapy use the command ``conda install gammapy -c
  conda-forge``. Most other packages have also moved to ``conda-forge`` in the
  past years, the previously used ``astropy`` and ``openastronomy`` channels are
  no longer needed.
- We now have a conda ``environment.yml`` file that contains all packages used
  in the tutorials. See instructions here: :ref:`tutorials`.

Documentation:

- We have created a separate project webpage at https://gammapy.org .
  The https://docs.gammapy.org page is not just for the Gammapy documentation.
- A lot of new tutorials were added in the form of Jupyter notebooks. To make the content of the
  notebooks easier to navigate and search, a rendered static version of the notebooks was integrated
  in the Sphinx-based documentation (the one you are looking at) at :ref:`tutorials`.
- Most of the Gammapy tutorials can be executed directly in the browser via the https://mybinder.org/
  service. There is a "launch in binder" link at the top of each tutorial in the docs,
  see e.g. here: `CTA data analysis with Gammapy <tutorials/cta_data_analysis.html>`__
- A page was created to collect the information for CTA members how to get started with Gammapy
  and with contact / support channels: https://gammapy.org/cta.html

Gammapy Python package:

- This release contains many bug fixes and improvements to the existing code,
  ranging from IRF interpolation to spectrum and lightcurve computation. Most of
  the improvements (see the list of pull requests below) were driven by user
  reports and feedback from CTA, HESS, MAGIC and Fermi-LAT analysis. Please
  update to the new version and keep filing bug reports and feature requests!
- A new sub-package `gammapy.maps` was added that features WCS and HEALPix based maps,
  arbitrary extra axes in addition to the two spatial dimensions (e.g. energy,
  time or event type). Support for multi-resolution and sparse maps is work in
  progress. These new maps classes were implemented based on the experience
  gained from the existing ``SkyImage`` and ``SkyCube`` classes as well as the
  Fermi science tools, Fermipy and pointlike. Work on new analysis code based on
  ``gammapy.maps`` within Gammapy is starting now (see `PIG 2`_). Users are
  encouraged to start using ``gammapy.maps`` in their scripts. The plan is to
  keep the existing ``SkyImage`` and ``SkyCube`` and image / cube analysis code
  that we have now mostly unchanged (only apply bugfixes), and to remove them at
  some future date after the transition to the use of ``gammapy.maps`` within
  Gammapy (including all tests and documentation and tutorials) is complete and
  users had some time to update their code. If you have any questions or need
  help with ``gammapy.maps`` or find an issue or missing feature, let us know!

Command line interface:

- The Gammapy command-line interface was changed to use a single command
  ``gammapy`` multiple sub-commands (like ``gammapy info`` or ``gammapy image
  bin``). Discussions on developing the high level interface for Gammapy (e.g.
  as a set of command line tools, or a config file driven analysis) are starting
  now.

Organisation:

- A webpage at https://gammapy.org/ was set up, separate from the Gammapy
  documentation page https://docs.gammapy.org/ .
- The Gammapy project and team organisation was set up with clear roles and
  responsibilities, in a way to help the Gammapy project grow, and to support
  astronomers and projects like CTA using Gammapy better. This is described at
  https://gammapy.org/team.html .
- To improve the quality of Gammapy, we have set up a proposal-driven process
  for major improvements for Gammapy, described in :ref:`pig-001`. We are now
  starting to use this to design a better low level analysis code (`PIG 2`_) and
  to define a plan to finish the Python 2-> 3 transition (`PIG 3`_).

**What's new?**

- Release and installation
    - Until now, we had a roughly bi-yearly release cycle for Gammapy.
      Starting now, we will make stable releases more often, to ship features and fixes to Gammapy users more quickly.
    - Gammapy 0.6 requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+, Numpy 1.8+, Scipy 0.15+, Astropy 1.3+, Sherpa 4.9.0+ .
      Most things will still work with older Astropy and Sherpa, but we dropped testing
      for older versions from our continuous integration.
    - Gammapy is now available via Macports, a package manager for Mac OS (``port install py35-gammapy``)
- Documentation
    - Added many tutorials as Jupyter notebooks (linked to from the docs front-page)
    - Misc docs improvements and new getting started notebooks
- For CTA
    - Better support for CTA IRFs
    - A notebook showing how to analyse some simulated CTA data (preliminary files from first data challenge)
    - Better support and documentation for CTA will be the focus of the next release (0.7).
- For Fermi-LAT
    - Introduced a reference dataset: https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-fermi-lat-data
    - Added convenience class to work with Fermi-LAT datasets
- gammapy.catalog
    - Add support for gamma-cat, an open data collection and source catalog for gamma-ray astronomy
      (https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat)
    - Access to more Fermi-LAT catalogs (1FHL, 2FHL, 3FHL)
- gammapy.spectrum
    - Better flux point class
    - Add flux point SED fitter
    - EBL-absorbed spectral models
    - Improved spectrum simulation class
- gammapy.image
    - Add image radial and box profiles
    - Add adaptive ring background estimation
    - Add adaptive image smooth algorithm
- gammapy.cube
    - Add prototype for 3D analysis of IACT data (work in progress)
- gammapy.time
    - Add prototype lightcurve estimator for IACT data (work in progress)
- gammapy.irf
    - Many IRF classes now rewritten to use the generic ``NDDataArray`` and axis classes
    - Better handling of energy dispersion
- gammapy.utils
    - Add gammapy.utils.modeling (work in progress)
    - Add gammapy.utils.sherpa (generic interface to sherpa for fitting, with models
      and likelihood function defined in Gammapy) (work in progress)
- Many small bugfixes and improvements throughout the codebase and documentation
