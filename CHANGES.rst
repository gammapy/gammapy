.. _gammapy_0p11_release:

0.11 (unreleased)
-----------------

Summary
+++++++

- The Gammapy v0.11 release is planned for March 2019.

**What's new?**

Gammapy v0.11 drops support for Python 2.7, only Python 3.5 or newer is supported (see `PIG 3`_).
If you have any questions or need help to install Python 3, or to update your
scripts and notebooks to work in Python 3, please contact us any time on the
Gammapy mailing list or Slack. We apologise for the disruption and are happy to
help with this transition. Note that Gammapy v0.10 will remain available and is
Python 2 compatible forever, so sticking with that version might be an option
in some cases. pip and conda should handle this correctly, i.e. automatically
pick the last compatible version (Gammapy v0.10) on Python 2, or if you try
to force installation of a later version by explicitly giving a version number,
emit an error and exit without installing or updating.

0.10 (2019-01-28)
-----------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released on Jan 28, 2019 (`Gammapy 0.10 on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gammapy/0.10>`__)
- 7 contributors
- 2 months of work

**What's new?**

Gammapy v0.10 is a small release. An option to have a background model with
parameters such as normalisation and spectral tilt was added. The curated
example datasets were improved, the ``gammapy download`` script and access of
example data from the tutorials via the ``GAMMAPY_DATA`` environment variable
were improved. A notebook ``image_analysis`` showing how to use Gammapy to make
and model 2D images for a given given energy band, as a special case of the
existing 3D map-based analysis was added.

A lot of the work recently went into planning the work ahead for 2019. See the
`Gammapy 1.0 roadmap`_ and the `PIG 7 - models`_ as well as `PIG 8 - datasets`_
and get in touch if you want to contribute. We plan to ship a first version of
the new datasets API in Gammapy v0.11 in March 2019.

Gammapy v0.10 is the last Gammapy release that supports Python 2 (see `PIG 3`_).
If you have any questions or need help to install Python 3, or to update your
scripts and notebooks to work in Python 3, please contact us any time on the
Gammapy mailing list or Slack. We apologise for the disruption and are happy to
help with this transition.

pyyaml is now a core dependency of Gammapy, i.e. will always be automatically
installed as a dependency. Instructions for installing Gammapy on Windows, and
continuous testing on Windows were improved.

----------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released on November 29, 2018 (`Gammapy 0.9 on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gammapy/0.9>`__)
- 9 contributors (3 new)
- 2 months of work
- 88 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new?**

Gammapy v0.9 comes just two months after v0.8. This is following the `Gammapy
1.0 roadmap`_, Gammapy will from now on have bi-monthly releases, as we work
towards the Gammapy 1.0 release in fall 2019.

Gammapy v0.9 contains many fixes, and a few new features. Big new features
like observation event and time filters, background model classes, as well as
support for fitting joint datasets will come in spring 2019.

The ``FluxPointEstimator`` has been rewritten, and the option to compute
spectral likelihood profiles has been added. The background and diffuse model
interpolation in energy has been improved to be more accurate. The
``gammapy.utils.fitting`` backend is under heavy development, most of the
functionality of MINUIT (covariance, confidence intervals, profiles, contours)
can now be obtained from any ``Fit`` class (spectral or map analysis). Maps now
support arithmetic operators, so that you can e.g. write ``residual = counts -
model`` if ``counts`` and ``model`` are maps containing observed and model
counts.

Gammapy v0.9 now requires Astropy 2.0 or later, and Scipy was changed from
status of optional to required dependency, since currently it is required for
most analysis tasks (e.g. using interpolation when evaluating instrument
responses). Please also note that we have a `plan to drop Python 2.7 support`_
in Gammapy v0.11 in March 2019. If you have any questions or concerns about
moving your scripts and notebooks to Python 3, or need Python 2 support with
later Gammapy releases in 2019, please let us know!

0.8 (2018-09-23)
----------------

Summary
+++++++

- Released on September 23, 2018 (`Gammapy 0.8 on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gammapy/0.8>`__)
- 24 contributors (6 new)
- 7 months of work (from Feb 28, 2018 to Sep 23, 2018)

**What's new?**

Gammapy v0.8 features major updates to maps and modeling, as well as
installation and how to get started with tutorial notebooks. It also contains
many smaller additions, as well as many fixes and improvements.

The new ``gammapy.maps`` is now used for all map-based analysis (2D images and
3D cubes with an energy axis). The old SkyImage and SkyCube classes have been
removed. All code and documentation has been updated to use ``gammapy.maps``. To
learn about the new maps classes, see the ``intro_maps`` tutorial at
:ref:`tutorials` and the :ref:`gammapy.maps <maps>` documentation page.

The new ``gammapy.utils.fitting`` contains a simple modeling and fitting
framework, that allows the use of ``iminuit`` and ``sherpa`` optimisers as
"backends" for any fit in Gammapy. The classes in `gammapy.spectrum.models` (1D
spectrum models) are updated, and `gammapy.image.models` (2D spatial models) and
`gammapy.cube.models` (3D cube models) was added. The ``SpectrumFit`` class was
updated and a ``MapFit`` to fit models to maps was added. This part of Gammapy
remains work in progress, some changes and major improvements are planned for
the coming months.

With Gammapy v0.8, we introduce the ``gammapy download`` command to download
tutorial notebooks and example datasets. A step by step guide is here:
:ref:`getting-started`. Previously tutorial notebooks were maintained in a
separate ``gammapy-extra`` repository, which was inconvenient for users to clone
and use, and more importantly wasn't version-coupled with the Gammapy code
repository, causing major issues in this phase where Gammapy is still under
heavy development.

The recommended way to install Gammapy (described at :ref:`getting-started`) is
now to use conda and to create an environment with dependencies pinned to fixed
versions to get a consistent and reproducible environment. E.g. the Gammapy v0.8
environment uses Python 3.6, Numpy 1.15 and Astropy 3.0. As before, Gammapy is
compatible with a wide range of versions of Numpy and Astropy from the past
years and many installation options are available for Gammapy (e.g. pip or
Macports) in addition to conda. But we wanted to offer this new "stable
recommended environment" option for Gammapy as a default.

The new ``analysis_3d`` notebook shows how to run a 3D analysis for IACT data
using the ``MapMaker`` and ``MapFit`` classes. The ``simulate_3d`` shows how to
simulate and fit a source using CTA instrument response functions. The
simulation is done on a binned 3D cube, not via unbinned event sampling. The
``fermi_lat`` tutorial shows how to analyse high-energy Fermi-LAT data with
events, exposure and PSF pre-computed using the Fermi science tools. The
``hess`` and ``light_curve`` tutorial show how to analyse data from the recent
first H.E.S.S. test data release. You can find these tutorials and more at
:ref:`tutorials`.

Another addition in Gammapy v0.8 is :ref:`gammapy.astro.darkmatter
<astro-darkmatter>`, which contains spatial and spectral models commonly used in
dark matter searches using gamma-ray data.

The number of optional dependencies used in Gammapy has been reduced. Sherpa is
now an optional fitting backend, modeling is built-in in Gammapy. The following
packages are no longer used in Gammapy: scikit-image, photutils, pandas, aplpy.
The code quality and test coverage in Gammapy has been improved a lot.

This release also contains a large number of small improvements and bug fixes to
the existing code, listed below in the changelog.

We are continuing to develop Gammapy at high speed, significant improvements on
maps and modeling, but also on the data and IRF classes are planned for the
coming months and the v0.9 release in fall 2019. We apologise if you are already
using Gammapy for science studies and papers and have to update your scripts and
notebooks to work with the new Gammapy version. If possible, stick with a given
stable version of Gammapy. If you update to a newer version, let us know if you
have any issues or questions. We're happy to help!

Gammapy v0.8 works on Linux, MacOS and Windows, with Python 3.5, 3.6 as well as
legacy Python 2.7.

Summary
+++++++

- Released on Feb 28, 2018 (`Gammapy 0.7 on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gammapy/0.7>`__)
- 25 contributors (16 new)
- 10 months of work (from April 28, 2017 to Feb 28, 2018)
- 178 pull requests (not all listed below)

**What's new?**

Installation:

- Gammapy 0.7 supports legacy Python 2.7, as well as Python 3.5 and 3.6.
  If you are still using Python 2.7 with Gammapy, please update to Python 3. Let
  us know if you need any help with the update, or are blocked from updating for
  some reason, by filling out the 1-minute `Gammapy installation questionnaire`_
  form. This will help us make a plan how to finish the Python 2 -> 3 transition
  and to set a timeline (`PIG 3`_).
- The Gammapy conda packages are now distributed via the ``conda-forge`` channel,
  i.e. to install or update Gammapy use the command ``conda install gammapy -c
  conda-forge``. Most other packages have also moved to ``conda-forge`` in the
  past years, the previously used ``astropy`` and ``openastronomy`` channels are
  no longer needed.
- We now have a conda ``environment.yml`` file that contains all packages used
  in the tutorials. See instructions here: :ref:`tutorials`.

Documentation:

- We have created a separate project webpage at https://gammapy.org .
  The https://docs.gammapy.org page is not just for the Gammapy documentation.
- A lot of new tutorials were added in the form of Jupyter notebooks. To make the content of the
  notebooks easier to navigate and search, a rendered static version of the notebooks was integrated
  in the Sphinx-based documentation (the one you are looking at) at :ref:`tutorials`.
- Most of the Gammapy tutorials can be executed directly in the browser via the https://mybinder.org/
  service. There is a "launch in binder" link at the top of each tutorial in the docs,
  see e.g. here: `CTA data analysis with Gammapy <notebooks/cta_data_analysis.html>`__
- A page was created to collect the information for CTA members how to get started with Gammapy
  and with contact / support channels: https://gammapy.org/cta.html

Gammapy Python package:

- This release contains many bug fixes and improvements to the existing code,
  ranging from IRF interpolation to spectrum and lightcurve computation. Most of
  the improvements (see the list of pull requests below) were driven by user
  reports and feedback from CTA, HESS, MAGIC and Fermi-LAT analysis. Please
  update to the new version and keep filing bug reports and feature requests!
- A new sub-package `gammapy.maps` was added that features WCS and HEALPix based maps,
  arbitrary extra axes in addition to the two spatial dimensions (e.g. energy,
  time or event type). Support for multi-resolution and sparse maps is work in
  progress. These new maps classes were implemented based on the experience
  gained from the existing ``SkyImage`` and ``SkyCube`` classes as well as the
  Fermi science tools, Fermipy and pointlike. Work on new analysis code based on
  ``gammapy.maps`` within Gammapy is starting now (see `PIG 2`_). Users are
  encouraged to start using ``gammapy.maps`` in their scripts. The plan is to
  keep the existing ``SkyImage`` and ``SkyCube`` and image / cube analysis code
  that we have now mostly unchanged (only apply bugfixes), and to remove them at
  some future date after the transition to the use of ``gammapy.maps`` within
  Gammapy (including all tests and documentation and tutorials) is complete and
  users had some time to update their code. If you have any questions or need
  help with ``gammapy.maps`` or find an issue or missing feature, let us know!

Command line interface:

- The Gammapy command-line interface was changed to use a single command
  ``gammapy`` multiple sub-commands (like ``gammapy info`` or ``gammapy image
  bin``). Discussions on developing the high-level interface for Gammapy (e.g.
  as a set of command l ine tools, or a config file driven analysis) are starting
  now. See :ref:`scripts`.


Organisation:

- A webpage at https://gammapy.org/ was set up, separate from the Gammapy
  documentation page https://docs.gammapy.org/ .
- The Gammapy project and team organisation was set up with clear roles and
  responsibilities, in a way to help the Gammapy project grow, and to support
  astronomers and projects like CTA using Gammapy better. This is described at
  https://gammapy.org/team.html .
- To improve the quality of Gammapy, we have set up a proposal-driven process
  for major improvements for Gammapy, described in :ref:`pig-001`. We are now
  starting to use this to design a better low-level analysis code (`PIG 2`_) and
  to define a plan to finish the Python 2-> 3 transition (`PIG 3`_).

Summary
+++++++

- Released on April 28, 2017 (`Gammapy 0.6 on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/gammapy/0.6>`__)

**What's new?**

- Release and installation
    - Until now, we had a roughly bi-yearly release cycle for Gammapy.
      Starting now, we will make stable releases more often, to ship features and fixes to Gammapy users more quickly.
    - Gammapy 0.6 requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+, Numpy 1.8+, Scipy 0.15+, Astropy 1.3+, Sherpa 4.9.0+ .
      Most things will still work with older Astropy and Sherpa, but we dropped testing
      for older versions from our continuous integration.
    - Gammapy is now available via Macports, a package manager for Mac OS (``port install py35-gammapy``)
- Documentation
    - Added many tutorials as Jupyter notebooks (linked to from the docs front-page)
    - Misc docs improvements and new getting started notebooks
- For CTA
    - Better support for CTA IRFs
    - A notebook showing how to analyse some simulated CTA data (preliminary files from first data challenge)
    - Better support and documentation for CTA will be the focus of the next release (0.7).
- For Fermi-LAT
    - Introduced a reference dataset: https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-fermi-lat-data
    - Added convenience class to work with Fermi-LAT datasets
- gammapy.catalog
    - Add support for gamma-cat, an open data collection and source catalog for gamma-ray astronomy
      (https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat)
    - Access to more Fermi-LAT catalogs (1FHL, 2FHL, 3FHL)
- gammapy.spectrum
    - Better flux point class
    - Add flux point SED fitter
    - EBL-absorbed spectral models
    - Improved spectrum simulation class
- gammapy.image
    - Add image radial and box profiles
    - Add adaptive ring background estimation
    - Add adaptive image smooth algorithm
- gammapy.cube
    - Add prototype for 3D analysis of IACT data (work in progress)
- gammapy.time
    - Add prototype lightcurve estimator for IACT data (work in progress)
- gammapy.irf
    - Many IRF classes now rewritten to use the generic ``NDDataArray`` and axis classes
    - Better handling of energy dispersion
- gammapy.utils
    - Add gammapy.utils.modeling (work in progress)
    - Add gammapy.utils.sherpa (generic interface to sherpa for fitting, with models
      and likelihood function defined in Gammapy) (work in progress)
- Many small bugfixes and improvements throughout the codebase and documentation
