    "# H.E.S.S. data with Gammapy\n",
    "\n",
    "[H.E.S.S.](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/) is an array of gamma-ray telescopes located in Namibia. Gammapy is regularly used and fully supports H.E.S.S. high-level data analysis, after export to the current [open data level 3 format](https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The H.E.S.S. data is private, and H.E.S.S. analysis is mostly documented and discussed at https://hess-confluence.desy.de/ and in H.E.S.S.-internal communication channels. However, in 2018, a small sub-set of archival H.E.S.S. data was publicly released, called the [H.E.S.S. DL3 DR1](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/dl3-dr1/), the data level 3, data release number 1. This dataset is 50 MB in size and is used in many Gammapy analysis tutorials, and can be downloaded via `gammapy download` (TODO: add link to description).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a quick introduction to H.E.S.S. data and instrument responses and contains some specifics that are important for H.E.S.S. users:\n",
    "- IRF formats and shapes\n",
    "- How to handle safe energy and max offset\n",
    "- EVENTS and GTI formats (e.g. how HESS 1, 2, configs, ... are handled)\n",
    "- Link to HESS Confluence where data and help is available (Slack channel)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then at the end, link to other analysis tutorials that are likely of interest for H.E.S.S. people, and add a few exercises. This can be short, a 5-10 min read. It's just supposed to be the \"landing page\" for someone new in H.E.S.S. that has never used Gammapy."
