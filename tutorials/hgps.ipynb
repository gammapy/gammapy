    "# HGPS\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS)** is the first deep and wide survey of the Milky Way in TeV gamma-rays.\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2018, a paper on the HGPS was published, and survey maps and a source catalog on the HGPS in FITS format released.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information, and the HGPS data for download in FITS format is available here:\n",
    "https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/hgps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please read the Appendix A of the paper to learn about the caveats to using the HGPS data. Especially note that the HGPS survey maps are correlated and thus no detailed source morphology analysis is possible, and also note the caveats concerning spectral models and spectral flux points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to work with the HGPS data from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to access the HGPS images as well as the HGPS catalog and other tabular data using Astropy and Gammapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the first part we will only use Astropy to do some basic things.\n",
    "* Then in the second part we'll use Gammapy to do some things that are a little more advanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is pretty long: feel free to skip ahead to a section of your choice after executing the cells in the \"Setup\" and \"Download data\" sections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are other tools to work with FITS data that we don't explain here. Specifically [DS9](http://ds9.si.edu/) and [Aladin](http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/) are good FITS image viewers, and [TOPCAT](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) is great for FITS tables. Astropy and Gammapy are just one way to work with the HGPS data; any tool that can access FITS data can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the following Python packages\n",
    "\n",
    "* [astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/)\n",
    "* [gammapy](https://docs.gammapy.org/)\n",
    "* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood all of those packages use Numpy arrays to store and work with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we will use the following functions and classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* From [astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/), we will use [astropy.io.fits](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/index.html) to read the FITS data, [astropy.table.Table](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/index.html) to work with the tables, but also [astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html) and [astropy.wcs.WCS](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/index.html) to work with sky and pixel coordinates and [astropy.units.Quantity](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html) to work with quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From [gammapy](https://docs.gammapy.org/), we will use [gammapy.maps.WcsNDMap](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/api/gammapy.maps.WcsNDMap.html) to work with the HGPS sky maps, and [gammapy.catalog.SourceCatalogHGPS](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/api/gammapy.catalog.SourceCatalogHGPS.html) and [gammapy.catalog.SourceCatalogObjectHGPS](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/api/gammapy.catalog.SourceCatalogObjectHGPS.html) to work with the HGPS catalog data, especially the HGPS spectral data using [gammapy.spectrum.models.SpectralModel](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/api/gammapy.spectrum.models.SpectralModel.html) and [gammapy.spectrum.FluxPoints](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/api/gammapy.spectrum.FluxPoints.html) objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for all plotting. For sky image plotting, we will use matplotlib via [astropy.visualization](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/index.html) and [gammapy.maps.WcsNDMap.plot](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/api/gammapy.maps.WcsNDMap.html#gammapy.maps.WcsNDMap.plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with Python, Numpy, Astropy, Gammapy or matplotlib yet, use the tutorial introductions as explained [here](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/tutorials.html), as well as the links to the documentation that we just mentioned."
