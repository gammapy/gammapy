    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `~gammapy.maps` submodule contains classes for representing sky images with an arbitrary number of non-spatial dimensions such as energy, time, event class or any possible user-defined dimension (illustrated in the image above). The main `Map` data structure features a uniform API for [WCS](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html) as well as [HEALPix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEALPix) based images. The API also generalizes simple image based operations such as smoothing, interpolation and reprojection to the arbitrary extra dimensions and makes working with (2 + N)-dimensional hypercubes as easy as working with a simple 2D image. Further information is also provided on the `~gammapy.maps` docs page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following introduction we will learn all the basics of working with WCS based maps. HEALPix based maps will be covered in a future tutorial. We will cover the following topics in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Creating WCS Maps](#Creating-WCS-Maps)\n",
    "1. [Accessing and Modifying Data](#Accessing-and-Modifying-Data)\n",
    "1. [Reading and Writing](#Reading-and-Writing)\n",
    "1. [Visualizing and Plotting](#Visualizing-and-Plotting)\n",
    "1. [Interpolating and Miscellaneous](#Reprojecting,-Interpolating-and-Miscellaneous)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have worked through the [Gammapy overview](overview.ipynb), because a solid knowledge about working with `SkyCoord` and `Quantity` objects as well as [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) is required for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is rather lengthy, but getting to know the `Map` data structure in detail is essential for working with Gammapy and will allow you to fulfill complex analysis tasks with very few and simple code in future!"
