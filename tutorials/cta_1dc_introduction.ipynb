    "In 2017 and 2018, the [CTA observatory](https://www.cta-observatory.org/) did a first data challenge, called CTA DC-1, where CTA high-level data was simulated assuming a sky model and using CTA IRFs.\n",

    "How to analyse the CTA 1DC data with Gammapy (make an image and spectrum) is shown in a second notebook [cta_data_analysis.ipynb](cta_data_analysis.ipynb). If you prefer, you can of course just skim or skip this notebook and go straight to second one."
