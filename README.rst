Contributing Code, Documentation, or Feedback
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Gammapy Project is made both by and for its users, so we welcome and encourage contributions of many kinds. Our
goal is to keep this a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community by abiding with the
`Gammapy Community Code of Conduct <https://gammapy.org/contribute.html>`_.

The Gammapy project uses a mechanism known as a `Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) <https://github.com/apps/dco>`_
to manage the legal aspect of contributions. The DCO is a legally binding statement that asserts that you are the
creator of your contribution, and that you wish to allow Gammapy to use your work to cite you as contributor.
Acknowledgement of this permission is described in the `Developer guide` of the official documentation.

Licence
+++++++
Gammapy is licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see the
`LICENSE.rst <https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/blob/master/LICENSE.rst>`_ file.

Supporting the project
++++++++++++++++++++++
The Gammapy project is not sponsored and the development is made by the staff of `the institutes supporting the project
<https://gammapy.org/team.html#support>`_ over their research time. Any contribution is then encouraged, as punctual or
regular contributor.
